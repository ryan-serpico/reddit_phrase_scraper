atlantahawks,fuck,"Win the lottery, draft Zion. Take whoever falls with the Mavs pick between Hunter, Culver, and Reddish and become the young hot boyz. Another note, we can’t rule out big free agents should we get Zion. Atlanta is dope, has yet to be taken by a modern superstar, and with that timeline we’d have the best farm and a lot of money. Huge offseason for us coming up and honestly we’re guaranteed to at least have a productive one, with the potential for an unprecedented splash certainly there.

atlantahawks,damn,"I hope we can pick up someone good in free agency at a reasonable salary, because next years free agency sucks. Only UFA I would even think of going after next year is Montrezl Harrell. And even that would be a long shot as I'm sure the Clippers would offer him a contract extension this summer worth much more. 

This free agency, some team(I hope it's not us) is going to foolishly offer Middleton a max (or damn near close to it) and then the asking price of players like Bojan Bogdanovic is going to substantially increase. I'd love to get Bogdanovic on our team, but not if the asking price for him is 20m+. 

We got a lot of good things going for us. Trae and JC are looking like future All-Stars, we might end up with 2 top 10 picks, and we have cap space. The most important thing right now is going to be how well we can utilize that cap space to our advantage. There's only 4 players this FA that are worth a max, two of them we shouldn't even try to go after as they're both PG's. The other two are SF's and either one would be the answer to our prayers.",04-25-2019,1556249372.0
atlantahawks,dick,"Since we're all agreeing no big moves, this should be the offseason we supplement our bench. I'm going to make a few assumptions here in that: 1. We don't pickup Baze at the same rate (Possibility of him resigning at a lower contract) 2. We absolutely DO NOT pick up Plumlee. This leaves us a hypothetical $84 million in 2020 Free Agency. 3. Let's shoot for two max contracts in 2020. Since none of the players on our roster would command a max contract, the highest we can offer a play is around $32 million. So let's keep $64 million available for 2020 free agency. Leaving $20 million for us to supplement our bench. 

Thinking about it now, I would love Brook Lopez, probably a $7-10mill deal for a couple of years. It's clear he can spread the floor however he wouldn't be a focal point of the offensive by any means.
The alternative to this, is resign Dedmond for roughly the same amount, since he had the best two years of his career he's probably going to be on the higher end. (He was $6.2 million in 2019). I'm completely fine with either, believing that Brook Lopez would be the cheaper option, Demond the ""better"" option. There's also the (very real) option of drafting Jaxson Hayes with our second top 10 pick and just ignoring this scenario in entirety. 

JJ Reddick TYPE PLAYER (Maybe even JJ Reddick). I'm hard pressed to believe that JJ reddick will stay in Philly so let's look at the alternatives. We're looking for a player who can consistently hit threes while not commanding much need for the ball in his hands so Trae can thrive. Another need for this position in the current landscape of the NBA is a versatile defender than can guard the 1-3 positions. 

Scenario 1: Danny Green, $10 million a year on the back end of his contract. A tremendous defender both on the ball and off the ball and grew up in the spurs organization. His three ball could be considered above average. I imagine we could secure him for 7-11 and would leave some wiggle room if combined with one of the center options. 

Scenario 2: Trevor Ariza, basically the same principles as Danny green. I'd argue that he's a better scorer than Danny but a worse defender. He's 33 now and would be a relatively cheaper option. I'm assuming somewhere in the $5-9 range. He played better in the Rockets scheme which I would argue is closer to our play style than the Wizards. 

Scenario 3: Wesley Matthews, while his contract in 2019 was to the tune of $19 million, he'll get NOWHERE NEAR that amount in 2020. He benefited on the huge salary cap increases. Basically the same thought process here as the other two. 

Basically, since we want to draft Reddish who would be a clear 2/3 combo guy, I'm looking to supplement him with a veteran who plays a similar play style. Cam SEVERELY under performed at Duke and I believe it's because he wasn't use to not having the ball as much as he did in high school. I'm thinking one of these veterans can come in and shed some light on Cam and help him transition into the NBA and accept his role on our team. 

These scenarios also work if we end up getting Deandre Hunter instead of Cam Reddish, they just wouldn't play a teaching role anymore. Looking at Hunter, he's an efficiency monster. His advanced metrics are great and he shot 42% from three last season. He's blossomed in an incredible defensive environment at UVA and could be a great compliment to John Collins & Trae Young as neither one of them really need the ball in their hand.

For our other potential top ten pick, I'd like us to pick either a speedy point guard to be a good backup for Trae or a versatile 4 that can supplement John Collins. I really like Coby White (I'm a big UNC fan so I'm a bit bias) because he's a speed demon and can consistently hit the three.

I think Reddick will be like a slightly more athletic Kyle Korver in terms of the role he plays and would be a great mentor to the young guys. Boogie is an injury-prone hothead who will demand max contracts if he’s going to stay, and I don’t think the hawks should go for a big free agent until contending is in the picture, which is hopefully sooner rather than later.

We draft Zion with the #1 pick after being blessed by RNGesus.

Zion is first team all-rookie obviously and ROTY.  Averaging something like 18/10 on crazy efficiency and there is all-star hype because the Hawks are in solid playoff range.

Trae and Collins are both all-stars because the Hawks are the 5th seed around all-star break.

State Farm is electric night in and night out.  We are now top 10 in attendance.

Hawks finish with the 5th seed.  They upset the 4th seed and take the 1st seed to 7 games in the semis.  Trae and Zion are spectacular in the playoffs.

Hawks now have title contender hype going into the 2020-2021 season.  ""They are only going to get better"" says every NBA pundit.

Is this a little far fetched? Yes but I honestly think its possible with some lottery ball luck.  Without Zion, I think we fight for the 8th seed and our rookies do better than most expected for their draft positions.",04-28-2019,1556460896.0

atlantahawks,shit,"Bill Simmons has an incredible book called The Book of Basketball that is about 700 pages long and covers a lot of the history of the sport, interesting moments, analysis of players, and generally covers a lot of discussion that anybody who watches would enjoy. It's very clear that he's a fan of the sport and the entertainment that comes from it, but he is by no means some sort of basketball expert. In the book he makes it clear that he has a bias, and the sticker on the edited version of his book mentions new takes on ""Lebron, Kobe, and the Celtics"" lmao. He pretty much only watches Celtics games during the regular season, and so as a result he doesn't really have an informed take past what any long-term Celtics basketball fan is going to know. All he knows is his division rival, the Hawks, had a bad record this year and that they traded Doncic. That's enough for him to unintelligibly shit on them whenever he can. So, I don't really blame him for being a clueless hack anymore than I blame most basketball fans for being a clueless hack. If the roles were reversed, we would probably have a couple people in here saying the same things about the C's.

That being said, he has some constant low-key sexism in just about everything he does as well as the length he goes to defend himself for some of the trivially dramatic things that have happened to him (getting fired from ESPN and losing Grantland). Here's some choice quotes:

>""Every time I watch Jason Kidd play, initially it’s like seeing a girl walk into a bar who’s just drop-dead gorgeous, but then when he throws up one of those bricks, it’s like the gorgeous girl taking off her  jacket and you see she has tiny mosquito bites for tits."" (quoting his friend)  
>  
>""...the erosions of LeBron’s passing skills is the biggest tragedy of the past few years other than Lindsay Lohan losing her boobs."" (not even really a good joke in general)  
>  
>""Well, the vast majority of WNBA players lack crossover sex appeal. That’s just the way it is. Some are uncomfortably tall and gawky, while others lack the requisite, um, softer qualities to captivate males  between 18 and 35. The baggy uniforms don’t help.

I could seriously go on for a LONG TIME looking for shit like this, and yeah, pretty much all of them were jokes written 10+ years ago, but it's riddled with it to the point to where it's a fair guess that Bill is still an arrogant, ignorant, immature guy who is pretty good at journalism and research. Sure, he's progressive and smart enough to correct himself, but he's still [a white dude from Boston born in '69](https://www.arandomwalker.com/blog/2017/10/22/bill-simmons-podcast-guests) who doesn't care all that much about people outside of himself, his family, and his friends. 

Here's some more if you really wanna feel better about his clownishness:

This proves tanking is pointless.  The Suns and the Cavs, both managing to win only two games more than the abysmal Knicks, won't be picking in the top three.  And I get it, this draft isn't expected to be that deep, but CJ McCollum went at #10, Giannis went at #15, hell, Jokić didn't go till the second round.  On the flip side the 2017 and 2013 first picks were complete busts, and the Wiggins (2014) is making max money to be one of the least efficient players in the league.

We were the ONE team in the top 10 that actually started winning games and trying to play better going about .500 after the ASG and we were punished with 8 and 10.

- Trade both picks. Either to move up, or hope we can improve the picks with future picks later. I doubt this happens, too much risk and because this draft isnt strong after the top 4-5 I just dont see someone in the top 4 accepting 8 and 10, thats a big drop in quality for the team trading back with Atlanta

- There is zero chance Atlanta finds an instant starter with these picks. Seems like the safe bet is Young/Huerter/Prince/Collins/Len is your starting 5 next year, maybe swap Baze with Huerter but the point doesnt change. You also have your 6th man in Baze or Huerter. You obviously take best player available at 8 and I think, hope, we go Bol Bol at 5, tack on 20-30 pounds to him and he's Lens replacement in his 2nd year. 

I dont know if Atlanta decides to tempt Cousins with his injury history but hes the only top flight free agent big off the top of my head, you put him at 5 and you got a really strong bench. 

The issue with 8 and 10 is you're either stuck drafting two career bench players in the top 10 or you get lucky on a gem. Maybe saying gem for a top 10 pick is bad but I've looked at the mock drafts and there just isnt much there.

White and Reddish seem like the two most pro ready guys who could potentially drop to 8 but I don't know if the Hawks would run a 2 PG system with White at 2. Culver could slide to 8 but hes not a good 3 point shooter and with Baze and Huerter there I just dont know what you do with him.

My personal wish if the draft plays out with Reddish, White, Culver going prior to Atlanta is having Little drop to 8 and Bol Bol sit there at 10. Little flashed a ton of potential the last month, Bol Bol I get fears on hes the definition of low floor high ceiling but hes 7'2"" with like a 7'5"" wingspan, or longer, add 20-30 pounds to him and you have a stretch 5 who can block shots.

Our front office needs to be less leaky, damn. The Bud-Ferry regime had its problems but one thing I'll give them credit for is that they always kept everything close to the vest.

This was a good post, though. I've gotten more comfortable with the idea of drafting Reddish ever since I realized that ""guy with a reputation for being the best shooter in his class but who unexpectedly ran into some efficiency struggles and also has trouble finishing at the rim"" is basically who we drafted last year in Trae Young, and Coach Pierce was successfully able to address those weaknesses.

It's a basketball move popularized in the early 2000s and now most people use it, just google it to see what it's all about.

>I've seen some stats for three pointers going crazy over the last few years, what's up with that and how are people getting SO much better at shooting 3's?

Stats dudes have realized that shooting 33% from 3 is the same as shooting 50% from 2, probably even better in most situations, so what teams have done is just got everyone to just start shooting 3 pointers, so everyone has gotten better since most teams don't want to sign players that can't shoot 3s. This has mostly gotten rid of the 'traditional big man' in the NBA, the player who just plays in the post, for example your yao mings or shaqs. Nowadays, you mostly have big men that can stretch the floor, and can shoot 3 pointers, something that Golden State really helped popularize and were kind of the first team to implement this strategy which is why they have been so good. Also, just this past year, shot clocks after an offensive rebound have been reduced to 14 seconds instead of resetting back to 24 seconds. Because of this, points and stats in general are inflated because the game is overall much faster paced, this means that way more 3s are being shot and made each game.

>Who do I hate (teams, not people, I do have a few opinions on some basketball personalities. 

The celtics have been somewhat historic rivals with the hawks dating back to the Wilkins era where we met a lot in the playoffs, then recently during the joe johnson era where we almost beat their 'super team' in the playoffs, and then even more recently when Al Horford left to them in a very messy way (he didn't thank the organization or fans or anything when he left and immediately started sucking boston's dick, people still hate him for it and rightly so) Also, there is probably going to be a rivalry with Dallas as long as they have Doncic and we have trae young, since there was a draft night trade that night and they will probably be compared their whole careers because of this and people will always be asking who won the trade. 

>What do the Hawks need to contend for playoffs? 

Everyone has differing opinions but imo we need a solid big man and another SG/SF that can stretch the floor, after this we can just pick up big names in free agency since I'm pretty sure we have a shit ton of draft space. We have 5 picks this coming draft so we will pick up some valuable pieces I'm sure. 

>Cause I've heard Trae and someone else whose name I can't remember are really good and exciting and I was wondering if it was gonna be like the Braves last year

Good players in the NBA are a lot different than in the MLB imo. They are much more consistant, most of us see trae's talent and think he's going to be something special, so I don't think you need to worry about that.

Stats dudes have realized that shooting 33% from 3 is the same as shooting 50% from 2, probably even better in most situations, so what teams have done is just got everyone to just start shooting 3 pointers, so everyone has gotten better since most teams don't want to sign players that can't shoot 3s. This has mostly gotten rid of the 'traditional big man' in the NBA, the player who just plays in the post, for example your yao mings or shaqs. Nowadays, you mostly have big men that can stretch the floor, and can shoot 3 pointers, something that Golden State really helped popularize and were kind of the first team to implement this strategy which is why they have been so good. Also, just this past year, shot clocks after an offensive rebound have been reduced to 14 seconds instead of resetting back to 24 seconds. Because of this, points and stats in general are inflated because the game is overall much faster paced, this means that way more 3s are being shot and made each game.

>Who do I hate (teams, not people, I do have a few opinions on some basketball personalities. 

The celtics have been somewhat historic rivals with the hawks dating back to the Wilkins era where we met a lot in the playoffs, then recently during the joe johnson era where we almost beat their 'super team' in the playoffs, and then even more recently when Al Horford left to them in a very messy way (he didn't thank the organization or fans or anything when he left and immediately started sucking boston's dick, people still hate him for it and rightly so) Also, there is probably going to be a rivalry with Dallas as long as they have Doncic and we have trae young, since there was a draft night trade that night and they will probably be compared their whole careers because of this and people will always be asking who won the trade. 

>What do the Hawks need to contend for playoffs? 

Everyone has differing opinions but imo we need a solid big man and another SG/SF that can stretch the floor, after this we can just pick up big names in free agency since I'm pretty sure we have a shit ton of draft space. We have 5 picks this coming draft so we will pick up some valuable pieces I'm sure. 

>Cause I've heard Trae and someone else whose name I can't remember are really good and exciting and I was wondering if it was gonna be like the Braves last year

Good players in the NBA are a lot different than in the MLB imo. They are much more consistant, most of us see trae's talent and think he's going to be something special, so I don't think you need to worry about that. Not to mention we have John Collins who is also a stud and Kevin Huerter who has been compared to Klay thompson (currently playing for golden state in the NBA playoffs), add in 2 more first round picks in this next draft and we have one of if not the brightest future in the NBA.",05-21-2019,1558471424.0

atlantahawks,shit,">Like what the hell is a Eurostep?

So essentially a Eurostep is a kind of drive to the basket. Say you're taking it to the hoop and your defender is in front of you waiting to contest your layup. To evade him, you take a step in one direction to guide the defender to where you want them to be (let's say to the left), then you immediately fake them out by stepping in the opposite direction (to the right) and cut in that direction while your defender is on the other side so you have a clear layup. This is all happening very quickly in a matter of two steps, I'd recommend watching YouTube videos about it to get a good visual of what it's all about (Manu Ginobili especially).

While I understand the draft combine is a huge deal and working out for teams is important, there are times when players perform much differently in a more competitive environment such as an actual NBA game. 

It's reasons like these (the players you've mentioned), that I always cross my fingers and hope we hit the jackpot one year with one of our early to late mid picks. I'm not saying scouting isn't important and all the work the team's do is pointless, but what I am saying is that sometimes it's pure luck.

The point I wanted to get across is that we have two top 10 picks this draft, our chances of getting a steal are VERY high. If we were to package those two picks to move, then we better be sure as all hell that the player we're picking is going to make the difference. Otherwise, we have two chances to pick up a Klay Thompson or a James Harden, instead of 1.",06-02-2019,1559510413.0

I know Beal and jimmy are different players but just trust me, it’s not worth it. It would be so much better to work our way up to a playoff caliber team on our own. Save that cap space for when we need depth to push us over the edge. The jimmy trade set the twolves back years and now look at lauri and Lavine. Even if Beal did come and we were suddenly contenders in the east, shit can change fast. Twolves were the 3 seed in the west for most of the season and then jimmy got hurt, we slipped and barely made the playoffs. You guys all know what happened next.

atlantahawks,hell,"hey everyone. i made some hawks concept jerseys and wanted to get some feedback from the fans. 

you can find the whole project on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Byny3NFhwL0/?igshid=qgd27shjcit) 

here’s some details on em:

-changed the primary color scheme to red, baby blue, and white. 

-city & earned color scheme remains white, black, and gold. 

-city & earned jerseys use throwback design w/ a slightly changed aesthetic. 

i know the hawks won’t have an earned jersey next season, but i made one for the hell of it. 

** this is the city jersey **

would love to know your thoughts on them.

atlantahawks,fuck,"Yeah stop being broke
jk here’s the most enlightening bit re: difficulties of playing defense with players that haven’t been together for years:

“San Antonio showed that for years. The core was there for years. It didn’t matter who they plugged in because they were going to learn the San Antonio system. It’s simple when the system is in place and the core is in place. You either get in, and you learn it, or you’re not going to make it. We’re a ball movement team, so you need to fucking learn how to move it. We’re not a hold team. You’re not making it if you can’t do that here. So, what I’m saying is we do have a core, but they are still learning the communication aspects of defense and the effort aspects of defense. I have a core who is still learning and then a new group who will have to be taught. In a lot of ways, it’s fucking frightening to think that we can be worse in that area next year just because the guys who weren’t very good at it last year will be better, but they are now going to be working with a younger and newer group.”

Next year's draft is suppose to be really deep for the first 8 picks. So they could look to grab a few picks. Chances are Pels are rebuild mode now. 

Zion is gonna need a year or two to adjust, Lonzo, Ingram, and Hart are young guys so it's a very young team. Lakers 4th this year probably trade bait. Lakers first next two years are gonna be trash cause Lakers will likely be in playoffs next few years with LeBron, AD, and likely Walker/Butler/Irving. Where they get this money fuck if I know. 

Anyways so Lakers future first are trash picks. But they could use the #4 to trade with say our Hawks or Bulls or Wizards or Hornets or someone to potentially have two picks in that first 8 picks",06-16-2019,1560669396.0

Pels would likely not take a PG with Lonzo..just a guess, maybe they would still take Garland.

Who is in play for DLo if Kyrie signs to the Nets?  We are screwed if the Suns or Bulls can sign DLo.

Good thing is that Pels have Ingram so maybe they don't want a wing.  Maybe they think he shows more promise than Lonzo (especially with his crazy father who might do something stupid like make him demand a trade) and so they take a swing at a PG just in case.

So chances are we could have a draft where actually none of the players are really on our team until the Lakers get their shit together.",06-19-2019,1560952861.0

atlantahawks,shit,"Serious response - Cam is a serious outlier in terms of how poorly he played at Duke.  I am inclined to attribute at least some of his horrible shooting metrics to a bad fit on a Duke team that struggled to shoot the ball all year long.  Zion is not a good shooter and RJ was another historically inefficient shooter - both of whom dominated the ball much more than Cam did, and clogged the paint.  Cam was visibly uncomfortable when driving as he was often running into Zion, RJ, Jack White or Bolden.  

I'm not trying to dismiss that there are VERY valid concerns about Reddish's game.  I watched every Duke game, at it was maddening to see Cam be as inconsistent as he was - what's most questionable is honestly his mentality which is what will be big to see in his first couple years in the league.  However, it was only that maddening because of how clearly talented Reddish is - in terms of a combination of pure basketball skill AND potential, I would honestly (not shitposting) say Reddish projects the best out of Zion and RJ.  If you take all of those players at their ceilings, Reddish projects to have the longest NBA career because of his skill on the ball.

I honestly think if Cam Reddish is going to pan out, the Hawks are a perfect situation for him- a high-tempo, well spaced 4 or 5 out offense that allows space for dribble penetration and spaces the floor.  He's far from a sure thing, and the statistics reflect that -> but as a low floor, high ceiling guy available in the mid-lottery, he's sure as hell worth taking a swing at.  I honestly thought the Cavs were going to take a chance at him with the 5th pick instead of Garland or the Pelicans/Wizards would take him at 8 or 9 (that's why I thought the Pels traded to 8 for), the Hawks got AMAZING value at the 10th pick.",06-21-2019,1561090747.0

atlantahawks,shit,"Also, it's worth noting that almost no player as talented as Cam Reddish is in ALL facets of the game (driving, finishing, feel for the game, passing) in recent NCAA history has ever been relegated to the role he had on Duke this past season.  On the prep level, his strengths were in his off the dribble moves and his all around game.  **He would've been a number 1 option at 99% of other D1 colleges at the country.  At Duke, he was utilized as a 3rd option spot up 3-point shooter who was essentially a 3-D player.**  His shittiness at Duke SERIOUSLY undersells his potential.

He's a good 3-point shooter, but not a great one - on a Duke team that needed 3-point shooting desperately he was often uncomfortably asked to take 3's he shouldn't have been taking.  Not to say he shouldn't have made more, but Duke's offense was clearly not comfortable for him.  Again, I firmly believe he's an absolute steal at 10.",06-21-2019,1561090956.0

Luka: 23/9/7 on 42/31/68, 54 TS%, team had a 13-27 record. 1.9 AST/TO ratio.

atlantahawks,hell,"Serious: We are not as bad as people think. We were a near .500 team when healthy this season, and that’s with half the roster being rookies or sophomores. Trae Young and John Collins are currently our best players, and will be All Stars in the next two years. 

Despite how good they are, coaching staff and some inside the FO of our team wholeheartedly believe Kevin Huerter is the most talented player on the team, and can emerge as a Bradley Beal/Joe Johnson type Guard/Forward with the ability to play both off ball and off the dribble. People like to compare him to Klay, but he honestly does not play much like him. For reference, Klay has been assisted on 98% of his threes for a while. Kevin in his rookie year was assisted on only 77% of his 3s. He has a great off the dribble game. Klay also isn’t a playmaker of any kind. Huerter, when he was out on the floor with Trae, was our secondary playmaker, and shows incredible potential on that end.

Cam is gonna be a project. I wasn’t super high on him coming in, but I definitely see the potential. It’ll just take a while. He’ll ride the bench as a 6th man for a little until he proves himself.

We run a super high pace, threes a blazin’ style of ball. We had by far the fastest pace in the league. Also we had one of the worst defenses in the league in account of our PG being pure offense and the rest of the team not even practicing defense. DeAndre Hunter will bring much needed spot up 3 point shooting (shot 44% in college this year) and terrific man to man defense to compensate for Trae’s deficiencies. He’s gonna be our 4 from Day 1.

We are still missing that one piece to take us over the edge. An elite center. Bruno Fernando was our second round pick that we traded up to get. He, along with Alex Len are our centers for now. Bruno played with Kevin Huerter in Maryland, very talented kid that plays hard every possession. He’ll bring in extra rebounding, good vertical spacing with the lob threat w/Trae, and good rim protection (something we sorely lack).

Alex Len is confusing as hell. We signed him last year as a flyer, and he started off the season atrociously. Couldn’t catch a pass, bricked open layups, was fouling instead of playing defense. Very few of us liked him. Then by the end of the season, I think most of us have done a complete 180 on him. Not enough to think he’s our C of the future. But enough to make us believe he can do something. He flashed a nice, new 3 point corner shot at the end. Had a couple 30 point games and looked dominant at times. I’m very interested to see if he improves this year.

We have enough cap space for 2 max slots in 2020. Sadly, it’s looking like an atrocious FA class, with the top name being Draymond. We will likely try to get him since we’re not doing anything else with the cap. We also need to save some cap because John will need to get paid in RFA in 2021, and Trae/Kev the following year. As long as you’re here, you gotta Trust in our GM, Travis Schlenk. It’s basically the only rule we have on this sub. He’s a God. Trust In Schlenk (TiTS)",07-01-2019,1562028073.0

atlantahawks,shit,"Omari shows flashes of a rotational stretch 4. He needs to lose the fat or risk inevitable injuries to the knees and hips, however.

Bruno has shown he play some serious defense, he has some decent handles too but still needs to work on the footwork and his outside shooting. He didn’t try to shoot the NBA ranged 3, for whatever reason. He passed up on them and either passed it or stepped inside for a long 2.

Hunter mid-range game looks good and he can clearly handle the ball some. Jumpshot needs more work tho.

Jaylen Adams...*sigh* words cant even describe how bad he is. Your local YMCA baller might be better than him. I mean, holy shit! He put up a brick factory, missed so many open guys on almost every single possession, chucked up every shot he possibly could. And to put the final nail in the coffin...for whatever reason...he decides to throw up a prayer shot during the last few seconds of the game when they were already down by 24. STILL missed the wide open shot, by the way lol Dude ended the game 3-12, 0-6 from three pt. range. He played 32 minutes and has 1 assists to show for it.",07-07-2019,1562548720.0

To me, he seems like a Marcus Morris as a very best case scenario or a Mo Speights as a more worst case - but still a contributing pro.  Obviously worst-worst case is Europe or China. 

Big dude who can bang dudes around in the post but is almost a little more comfortable from the arc and has to be respected out there.  I would take a Mo Speights, though.   That's not a bad piece to the puzzle.  But if he was detracting from the culture coach is trying to create, he had to go.  We have such a young team that the culture isn't rock solid yet.  GSW might work better for him since that's a veteran team with an established culture and they don't have to worry about a lazy guy contaminating young guys with his unprofessionalism.

atlantahawks,shit,"First things first- this sub is notorious for its shit-posting, so don't expect many real answers. There's a meme guide posted somewhere. I'll try my best though.

The Hawks actually have a better history of ""success"" then they get credit for- they had the second longest playoff appearance streak (behind the Spurs) until 2 seasons ago. After years and years of first and second round exits (with one incredibly exciting season where we went undefeated in the month of January, and eventually made the ECF), we got a new GM in Travis Schlenk (one of the architects of the GSW), and the decision was made to tear it down. Since then, we've drafted a new core of Trae Young, John Collins, Kevin Huerter, De'Andre Hunter, and Cam Reddish- led at the helm by now-sophomore coach Lloyd Pierce. They probably won't be great next season, but they are an incredibly fun team to watch, playing an exciting brand of basketball. If everything goes well, there is a fringe possibility of making the playoffs.

Trae Young - Sophomore guard, passing savant, unlimited range, great handles. Needs to work on defense.

John Collins - 3rd year F/C, rim-running big man that pairs perfectly with Trae's passing. On the receiving end of many alley-oops. Has expanded shooting range to be league-average three point shooter. Also needs to work on defense (although that has seemed to marginally improve).

Kevin Huerter - Red man shoot basketball good.

De'Andre Hunter - Rookie F who is projected to have a very high floor. Good shooter. Great defender.

Cam Reddish - Rookie F who was forced to play third banana at Duke. Projected knock down shooter that had awful season. Dropped to 10 in the draft. Should be solid defender, but really a bit of a gamble/unknown commodity.",07-26-2019,1564145118.0

I really really believe he can be that good. His removal of post looks absolutely amazing. He's getting tons of hate with such a lazy mod team - imagine him with an actually good mod team.

His shitposting. If you've been watching, he basically nails any copypasta, as he should. So it's not that his actual mod ability is shaky, it's really his post removal selection. More moderation options on the mod team means he doesn't have to take those shitpost down, which, to be honest, he's actually cut down a bit on. He has like 4-5 shitpost week, but that's really cuz we have such a shit mod team. Post removal selection is something that most rookie mod’s do eventually improve on, and since that's Olaf’s biggest weakness, it's a very very good sign.

His streamable clips. He hustles and tries hard, but unfortunately his physical attributes are not there. There are multiple times when I see him go for a really nice clip of Bembry doing something cool and he would get it if his streamable clips were like 3-5 seconds longer. So streamable clips will never be his thing, but that's okay, as long as he tries isn't the worst streamable clip maker on the mod team.

His weaknesses according to his moderator draft profile are almost nonexistent to me. One thing is finishing off his political opponents (like chili), but I don't think it's because of his size, like most reports said. Those are easy political opponents he will eventually kill with more consistency. His not-so-great physical attributes haven't really been hindering him at all other than on streamable clips. His pinning to the sub is still a threat, he can beat anyone on the mod team at that (that I've seen so far), and he can shitpost through bad times regardless of his size.

atlantahawks,hell,"Team defense is all that matters and that will get better with age, experience, and playing together. Schlenk tried to addressed the biggest issue of wing defense in the draft and with his offseason moves. Now the hawks can hide trae young with the types of defensive lineups they can throw out there.

I’m unconcerned about John Collins’s individual defense. His lack of production on defense was more random/health and learning to play PF instead of Center. Now that the hawks have bigger wings he can play more Center where he’s able to be more of an athlete (what he does best as a defender) instead of guarding spot up shooters. 

Trae Young And Kevin Huerter should both be better the older/stronger they get. Huerter has the size/length/athleticism to be good on that end. Huerter’s issue was that he was paper thin and weak. He won’t be such a chump 3 years from now.

Trae young is an unknown. He’s not the worst defensive player in nba history, he’s not even the worst defender in hawks history (hello mike Bibby And Jamal Crawford) but the issue all last season was that they could never hide him. (Whereas with bibby the hawks played 4 like sized switchable defenders) For better and for worse other than Bembry he was the only rotation player that could guard PG’s. But with the addition of Hunter/Reddish and potential improvement from Huerter that shouldn’t be the case. I would suspect Trae young through sheer inertia should be a much improved defender overall but how much will ultimately come down to him.

I don't understand the hate for moving up in the draft when we weren't going to have 5 rookies on our roster this year. We are already young as it is, and having 5 rookies would mean little to no veteran presence to help develop our young guys.

None of the guys you mentioned fit our system: 

Windler and Herro are great shooters, but they dont have the high defensive potential like Reddish and Hunter do.

Carsen Edwards would be a horrible backup for Trae cause we need a better defensive PG to contrast Trae.

I liked Rui too, but I think having good 3&D players are what works in the NBA today and thats what both Hunter and Reddish have the potential to be.
