gonets,dick,"Unpopular take: Caris is getting overrated on this sub at least.

   I don't want to be a dick and honestly I feel guilty. Listen I'm a fan through and through so I have to support our guys. I love Levert and saw talent in him the night we got him. I won't also lie and say for a portion of last year I rooted for D lo be our guy. It is hard to explain, but whether Caris is better or whatever, can we be reasonable. For one, I never seen a player with a samll sample size be penicled in as a star. Caris played in under 30 games this whole year. I know people already loved him in his sophomore year, but I never was blown away by him. He improved a lot this year but the guy is still a ?. The guy's game is too glorified as his offense is heavily reliant on his driving. His shooting is still a ? and his offensive game is predictable like I said. But I just get annoyed how he is seen as the clear best player and reason why we are here when D lo, Din, and Harris were responsible for majority our success. I am sorry but I just get annoyed with some of the Levert praise. He did great in the playoffs and was very arguably our best player the first 14 games this year. Won't deny that but it's a small sample size and guys like Josh Richardsona nd ROdney Mcgruber were putting similar number to Levert during that stretch.",07-06-2019,1562428361.0

gonets,shit,"1. **Philly - 58 wins** they clearly have the best team this year but Embiid’s health could cause them to drop

2.  **Brooklyn - 54 wins** Nets are a lot better then the team that won 42 games last year and without a healthy LeVert, we wouldn’t have lost 11 games in a row. 

3. **Bucks - 52 wins** I know I am going to catch shit for this but they lost Brogdan and Mirotic and replaced them with Wes Matthew and John Lauer. We have a much easier division with NY, Tor being weak and the Celtics severely weakened. 

After that is a free for all. Boston lost the backbone of their team in Kyrie, Horford and Marcus Morris. They swapped Kemba for Rozier which is an upgrade but Kemba is not on Kyrie’s level and they still need to replace Rozier if you think Kemba does replace Kyrie. 

Indy lost Bogdanovic but got Brogdon. I would probably put them over Boston. 

I think the rest of the east is going to be lucky to break.500",07-06-2019,1562447255.0
gonets,fuck,"Dude why are you sensitive? If I was a D lo only fan I would leave. Stop getting butthurt Levert can't be all liked. Its like politics. I just think this fanbase has put Levert as this golden pedestal and sometimes so much that it rubs some people off. D lo was my favorite player on this team and I won't lie how I felt annoyed how the last months of his time here, people discredited his success to prop up Levert. It is not fair to some that D lo's season was a  wash cause Levert had 14 good  games in the year. Even if levert has it, 14 games is 14 games, you shouldn't just do that. His offensive game is overrated. Hie is predictable and there is a chance he cang et serisuly exposed without improving his jumper. But the fanboys are annoying as fuck. It disrespects what D lo did and guys like Din. He played in under 30 games, I have never seen a player so hyped with that sample size, then maybe that boy you hated in Jeremy Lin in NY. Levert is better than Lin, but jsut saying, sample size matters.",07-06-2019,1562424451.0

gonets,shit,"Dude I'm sorry. I'm going to be nice as possible. But Levert i the new D lo and is getting overrated.

  I have to root for him and whatever but I have never seen a player with the smalles sample size ever and is already deeemed a star. levert played a good 14 games at the start of the year, where guys like Rodney Mcgruber and Josh Richardson were putting identical numbers btw, a good like last five games of the year, and then a good playoffs. That is like what under 30 games? LIke I know D lo played maybe a good 60 games at best, but it gets annoying how D lo was overrated and was lucky Caris got injured, but the facts are Caris has only played under 30 games.

  I just don't like annointing players as the best players on the team when you were't even a big aprt of the year. I agree he has the best talent from last year's team outside D lo who is now gone, but the guy is getting wayt to glorified. His offesnive game is still limited. I won't count him out, as guys like Rose, in  some ways Lebron, and players have been great scorers without complete offensive games, but his offensive game is literally driving to the rim and that's it. He isn't a great shooter still (playoffs is a short sample size) and yeah helooks good, but teams can adjust to him with him being noticed. He can do good as he proabbly is too good with his driving ability, but I won't pencil it, I just don't see how he better offensively than D lo, who outside finishing, could scorer from many places when you needed.

 Also his defense is getting overrated. I ahve seen many times where he gets beat of screens and is far from this defensive player of the year candidate.

  I won't lie and say I always beleived D lo was better and liked him more, that's in the past. Levert is a good player and honestly when we drafted saw the talent. But he has become obnoxiously so hyped on this sub and its just annoying. Its funny we shit on the Celtics for overhyping their players but we are literally doing the same with Levert. LIke Rozier and the other young guys did jsut as great as Levert in last year's playoffs tbh, and many players can have a good playoffs and a bad playoffs.
 
 Like I said I agree Levert has that talent, and east talent has dwindeled a bit. But I am not totally convinced. I just thinks its arrogant guys saying easily he will make it. It was never like that with guys ike D lo and even Din who have done more for this team than Levert. The playoffs was good but doesn't take away who brought us here.",07-06-2019,1562423514.0

It was bad for sure, but it could've been way worse. But if D Will played like a top three PG, Lopez developed into a betetr rebounder and shooter, and PG or PP didn't run out, we would've been much better. Also people forget that 2014 team were great in the second half of the year. If we didn't get Miami that year, we could've made it to the ECF if we got the Pacers. I still don't think ti was necessary to do that cause in 2013 we had a decent playoffs. We also should've tried to trade for younger players. if we traded those picks for more established stars, it could've been better.

What Marks and the F/O have achieved is nothing short of miraculous in the timeframe they’ve operated.

So many players have come and gone, and yeah the chemistry of last season’s team has been the greatest that I’ve personally witnessed in this short time. However, as a fan of the team, I want to see Brooklyn achieve true success and be a part of supporting it. The team over the next couple of years is going to be relevant, exciting and contending.
This is a bittersweet moment. Of course I’d love the effort and hardworking team of 18-19 to win a championship; league or conference, in the next few years, but realistically it would be a stretch. However, now we have a realistic chance. And not only that, the F/O hasn’t changed too dramatically, we’re going to be ok, we will have chemistry, we will be extremely fucking fun to watch. Be proud.

More likely the later, but sometimes with these old coaches you just can’t be sure. His analysis of what was going on was often way off point. But since they often didn’t actually talk about the game on the court, I suppose it didn’t matter. 

Seems like the Nets might have just turned it on in the fourth and maybe they knew they could. Hard to say. But they went from tied at the end of the third (or very close to tied) to a 20 point lead. Croatia basically lost all ability to score. Kurucs looks good. J. Allen certainly defended just fine. Claxton looks like a very good athlete. Musa’s shot isn’t going down for the second game in a row. But he is getting to the free throw line which is the most important thing for him to develop into being a first or second option scorer (first option might be a bridge too far for him, but I wouldn’t rule it out quite yet).",07-07-2019,1562538133.0

Then the short stint at Prudential Center. I thought, holy crap this arena is beautiful! But it never felt like a ""home arena"" because of the Devils store, jerseys and murals on the wall. They knew the Nets were leaving soon so no one bothered to put up any Nets decor.

Then came the move to Brooklyn, into a brand new Barclays Center. I went to the first game and my jaw dropped. Everything was cool, hip, and modern. They put so much thought into fine details - the Brooklyn-themed concessions were actually good, the herringbone court design, multiple Nets apparel stores, and even the arena staff are Disney-trained to provide a superior customer experience. The team color and logo rebrand was so well done that even non-basketball fans wear Brooklyn gear because of how nice they look. It floors me to this day when I travel out of the country and see someone wearing Brooklyn Nets apparel. Then the ""Broooooooklllyyyyn"" chant - gave me chills.

But D lo is someone I grew attached too  and it sucks. 

   I got annoyed at Lopez fans getting butthurt when he got traded, but the irony is, I understand their pain now. I'm not going to get into the debates with the player vs player, or what you say about D lo's game, but I alwasy wanted him to be a Net when we got him. He was battered and was the perfect guy I saw that could be a star for us.

  That's why I hope people get why some here hold him to a high standard. I'm more exicted for Kyrie and KD and rightfully so. It is that players can mean a bit more to a team and I wish people understand that. I know D lo was here for two years but he earned a lot of debates to be here more.

We made it clear picking Kyrie over D lo and letting everyone who brought energy to favor Dinwiddie, Caris, and Allen who they believed is more talented. I wish this FO just stopped this innocent bullcrap and act they are like the Spurs who get exaggerated as some model franchise.

   Like I said the main energy and leaders are gone. I keep hearing people say guys like Din and Caris are the real leaders, but who were the guys who led us during the 26-8 run? Din out of our remaining old core is the only guy who did but please don’t tell me he will be the sole leader of this team compared guys like Dudley and Carroll were. This guy just bragged he ran players out of town. But the D lo drama makes me laugh. It is what it is but not going to make Dinwiddie some innocent perfect human-like this fanbase has been celebrating.  Keep it private and everything would be fine.

I'm a 31 year old Los Angeles resident and have been a Nets fan since high school. My friends and I were religious Fantasy Basketball players and during one season, I ended up with VC, RJ, and Kidd on my team. I had no ties to the Nets yet, but had to follow Nets games all of a sudden for obvious reasons. I ended up loving the team (I mean, who wouldn't with those 3) and continued to even after that particular fantasy year. During my 3rd year of college, I was bored one summer and decided to email the Nets' HR department to see if they had any available internships for college students, and lo and behold they did. Long story short I got the job in their Operations department and moved to Jersey to work for them for about 3-4 months. Lived in Lyndhurst, commuted to East Rutherford. I ended up going to a ton of games (way more than I ever imagined I would), rebounded for Anthony Morrow during shooting practice, regularly passed by Sam Mitchell and Avery Johnson saying ""Hey, coach"", helped Chocolate Thunder (Darryl Dawkins, RIP) when he locked his keys in his car, and made some friends in the organization that I'm still friends with today. I also had a long chat with Bobby Marks on how to make it in the organization, which was cool. Also got to visit the Izod Center...that place looked desolate but being in that arena where the Nets played in the Finals gave me chills.

gonets,fuck,Again Marks refuses a big. Like come on man seriously.  It’s like I’m getting better but then this shot happens. Beans isn’t even bad but he won’t even play and is a waste of a spot for his sake and the team. If we wanted to move on from our old players  get a big. But he again goes for BS players below 6ft9. We will be fucked in the playoffs again if D.J. or Allen go down. This small ball Bs is a ? People refuse to fix. It’s so obvious this guy loved his athletic players and stats. Let the downvoted begin for speaking my mind. I trust Marks but not the obxnoius way some on this sub do. You need bigs to win and we only have two legit bigs. We don’t even have a PF outside Rodi. It’s a legitimate issue and he still refuses after signing two stars.,07-14-2019,1563122238.0
gonets,fuck,We're so fucked in the front court. We should have went after a 4 that can play 5 in a pinch. Instead we only have 2 centers and 3 tweener 4s. Why did we load up on middling guards when we have so much depth there is beyond me.,07-14-2019,1563121115.0

gonets,fuck,Marks continues this annoying guard rotation. If it works fine but keep downvoting me if I complain that Marks praise is getting obnoxious as fuck. First of all this is disrespectful for Nwaba. Guy is not going to get his minutes like he did in Cleveland. But we literally have no PF outside maybe Rodi. It’s fristrating some players were thrown the door easily to just be replaced by useless guards. This is ridiculous. KYRIe and KD and D.J. were understand able but what does Nwaba do in the playoffs? It makes me laugh. It’s obvious Marks has a thing against certain players and want his unproven style. I don’t mind going athletic and small but you need four legit bigs in this league on your team. We literally have four. Rodi is still a young PF. I’m tired of Marks continuing his small ball analytic craze. It’s hilarious people think some players were at fault for the Philly serious when it is clear our terrible front court cost us that series.

But his individual play on the court in Boston was stellar for the majority of the time.

gonets,shit,"Holy shit, okay I'm going to say it. He recently followed Dominique Wilkins on Instagram, probably asking him right now about Achilles recovery tips and tricks and KD is going to have the best season of his career in Brooklyn.",07-29-2019,1564423515.0
gonets,hell,"Three reasons why KD will still be an All Star level player: 

1. Pre-Injury Level: KD was a top 2 player before the injury. No player in NBA history who tore their Achilles was good AS KD was. Wilkins is the closest and he came back well. Kobe, was already on the tail end of his career. 

2. Playstyle: Dont get me wrong, KD relies a lot on speed and athleticism. It’s those qualities that make him so unique - a 7ft who moves like a guard. However, even if the injury affects this in a huge way, what can’t be taken away from him is his height, shooting ability and skill. At the very least - he will have an old man game: shooting over the top of guys, post fadeaways, midrange gimmes. 

3. MOI: KD is a right handed player and he tore his right Achilles. The left Achilles for a right handed player is in charge of managing the load, force and weight when a right handed player jumps off, goes for a layup, burst with speed and lands during jump shots. Every single player who was right handed and has tore their left Achilles - came back a shell of themselves. Their is one player (I believe) who tore his right Achilles and came back well - Dominique Wilkins. 

I’m not being crazy optimistic. The truth is this injury can lead to other injuries down the line that derails KDs career which is possible. The truth is the biggest affect will be KDs defense and there’s a good chance he’s a negative on the floor. 

But if he can avoid any future injuries - KD is still a top 5 offensive player in the game.",07-29-2019,1564425542.0
gonets,damn,"Kyrie was buddies with Smart. Kyrie's not a horrible monster and Smart knows this. It's actually ridiculous how much the media and the Boston fanbase has obsessed and nitpicked over him to the point it's damn near creepy.

Also in the Bucks series, they were all sucking major booty when they were losing. Stevens was coaching like ass too.

Kyrie and Smart were probably the top two players on the Celtics all last season, throw in Marcus Morris to round it off to those 3.
