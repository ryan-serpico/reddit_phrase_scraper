nbaspurs,shit,"When he canceled the meeting in NYC after Pop and Timmy had already flown in, I was livid. I understand him having a gripe with the medical team, but you take the meeting with Pop, even if you don’t want to stay. It’s just a matter of professionalism. That was peak anger for me. But in reality, we don’t know what else was said and done behind closed doors. These days, I’m not so angry. I can watch him play and somewhat enjoy it. I’m happy with our Spurs team right now. Sure, we would have been better with him, but I’m enjoying what we’re doing. I have faith in PATFO, and so I’ve for the most part let it go. It’s not worth it for our sub to be bitter. Instead of wasting our team shit talking him, we should be focused on our current roster and try to predict who will be our next finals MVP. Murray or White??

nbaspurs,shit,"I think this validates the Spurs for asking as much as they did for Kawhi. If Lakers weren't being bitched about it they would have met the trade demand and wouldn't be stuck this far through free agency with their dick in their hand and so much cap space with no free agents left to sign.

&#x200B;

I love that Boston is looking like shit too for refusing to trade their young guys.

&#x200B;

Philly is looking like the second best team, and they were the only ones with a young core to make moves. I think that shows when you have a chance to trade for an established star, you do it. You don't wait for them in free agency.

&#x200B;

I'm glad the Clips got him. Their fan base gets so much disrespect from laker fans and the league in general. I respect Kawhi for not taking the easy road and taking on the challenge to build his own team and success with the Clippers. 

&#x200B;

And even tho raps won the title this year (your welcome toronto, enjoy rebuilding), I think Kawhi leaving gives us more value in the trade, especially with us nabbing Keldon, who looks like he could be a steal...

&#x200B;

You also have rumours of Boogie inquiring about joining SA, not that I think he will or should take what we have left, but it's a positive sign, suggesting that players still respect SA and Pop and consider this a worthwhile place to consider playing. I'm just glad we re upped Rudy. This is our team for the next couple years! Run it back. Lets go out and make the conference finals! West is pretty wide open with a bare Lakers roster, and a recouping Warriors roster. There's some teams coming up, hopefully we can be one.",07-06-2019,1562404434.0

nbaspurs,fuck,"He didn't quit on us. It sucks he didn't want to be a part of this team, but I'm sure you watched all the post games and such. Kawhi spoke openly about the past season or two, and one thing that came up was that he didn't like how he felt that Spurs ""stopped believing in me.""

&#x200B;

A lot of people doubted his status. The dude was limited to 60 games this season and, again, openly said he didn't think he'd be playing in the finals if they didn't limit him to that amount of games. It's pretty obvious SA and Kawhi had a disagreement as to how much he should play. To me, i find it's obvious the Spurs didn't understand his injury/condition, but I don't think we fucked up... We just aren't the type of team to pander to our stars... water under the bridge.

We were blessed to have Kawhi and Danny for the year and win a championship, we're thanking the Spurs for letting us taste that. Legit from the bottom of my heart lol 

I now know how y'all felt over the last couple years with Kawhi's diva mentality and his Uncle making decisions for this 28 year old man. He wanted to be in LA from the start. 

Y'all have a great future infront of you with Deebo. That man's as loyal as they come in the league. Gets better every single year too, the biggest gym rat. Poeltl is young as hell and will be your starting 5 in no time. Young guys like Murray and White, in that organization with that coaching staff. Y'all have it made!

nbaspurs,shit,"Limited minutes, no back to backs. Got shut down indefinitely, was given the agency to manage his rehab.

Durant's was different, he played too many minutes the first time he got back, he wasn't eased into it because of the stakes. You can blame some of the pressure on Kawhi too, who famously said, if you can run, then you can probably play since it's the finals. The videos that documented Durant's first injury indicated a possible achilles tear prior to the actual accident, Kawhi's was from overuse and was considered degenerative.

He wasn't obligated to stay, and was non-committal at best which was understandable. It was a detour, because the destination was really LA, meaning the Spurs were the only team shafted here since he tanked his value prior to his departure. Sure we got DeRozan, Poeltl and Samanic but it was truly lopsided, IMO. Toronto was a bit of a doormat honestly, giving him more than necessary but they got what they wanted at the end, and I suppose that's what ultimately matters.

The Lakers' FO's ineptitude is one of the main reasons Kawhi didn't want to join them, coming from the Spurs to another well-run organisation in the Raptors. LeBron too, has different priorities. He's gonna need some rest, as well as AD, which leaves no room for him to rest himself without missing the playoffs. But then the Clippers are scrappy as fuck, and capable of winning games without him just like the Raptors. So it truly is the best destination.

You gotta remember his sister's Instagram live, though. Also, Spur for life? ""For sure."" He accused our FO of lying about how he didn't want to play for no franchise... Well. This was all premeditated. Compare his free agency to LaMarcus'.

Don't pull the emotion card here. He repped San Antonio for 6 seasons, then he went home every summer. The catalyst for this shitfest was his agent parting ways with him, and his uncle's discovery of an ambition to rival Rich Paul because he's not getting a cut from his nephews' salary, just his endorsements and again, agent fees (see lawsuit).

Kawhi is a nephew. Confirmed. I understand he wants to be closer to kin, but a year isn't that long. He should've honoured his contract with the Spurs and moved on without all this hullabaloo. And we didn't trade with any West teams to keep him out of our conference, most importantly out of reach from our rivals. PATFO can only do so much.",07-06-2019,1562433964.0

If more teams had the Raptors’ gall we’d have gotten more for Kawhi, even if it was still eventually a trade with the Raptors. I understand why Philly and Boston had their reluctances. They had younger players with more flexibility and upside at the time than the Raptors had with Demar. It was objectively an easier decision for Toronto to gamble on Kawhi than Philly or Boston.

Kawhi likely leaves either of Boston/Philly just the same after winning a title. Had they not won the Finals they’d have felt like idiots trading for Kawhi only for him to walk. It seemed risky at the time for them for good reason; it was risky. Although both those teams seem further from winning a title now than they would have been last year with Kawhi. The Raptors would have never won a title without extenuating circumstances from the Spurs, but other teams had the same option to gamble on Kawhi and give us **something** back for him and weren’t willing. So screw those other teams I say! You want to value the security of long term “contention” over the chance at Kawhi Leonard, see how it plays out for yourselves.

In the context of how scared teams were of Kawhi going to LA, his injury, and the fact the disgruntled star was disgruntled with the Spurs, I feel we got a fair trade. It’s one thing for a star to leave a team he’s held back by substantially, other GM’s must have been put off by Kawhi forcing his way out of San Antonio. It was by no means fair value for him had that not happened, but that wasn’t reality so I’m happy with how we did.",07-06-2019,1562438122.0

Okey so this is basically what we have done so far:


- **Drafted Luka Samanic and Keldon Johnson.** I loved our picks. They will probably not play a single minute this season. But I see it as a nice and soild investment for the future. Hopefully they will follow the development success in our G-league squad. 


- **RESIGNED RUDY.** This was such a important move. I was quite worried about him leaving, but he STAYED!!! Love the work Rudy has given this team.


- **Signed Demarre and Marcus Morris.** I was so happy with the Demarre signing. I was eyeing Garrett Temple, but Demarre fills the needs this team have. Hopefully Marcus can fit properly and follow the team culture. 


- **Lonnie's development.** Maybe he can get some minutes this year. If he is good, that means that we don't have to watch Marco run around playing defense like he is a traffic cone. I'm really excited about him.


- **Getting Murray back.** Hopefully he is all good and ready to play. He was awesome in 17-18.


- **Derrick White being a boss.** Hopefully Derrick continue his awesome play from the previous season and merge into a super high quality player.


The bad:


- **Losing Messina and Udoka.** But hey, Pop probably can extend his coaching tree and find others to fill the holes. We still have Becky, which is nice.


- **Losing Bertans.** This was also tough, but I'm happy with the other moves we made to improve the team. As the great american philosopher Bruce Springsteen once said; *The price you pay*.

nbaspurs,fuck,"Imo the Spurs did pretty good ever since they traded kawhi. Stayed allert and active. But didn't before that. They had found their heir to the throne and kind of got lackadaisical. I think if kawhi was upset with the fo, it's cause they didn't pair him with a younger star asking for a trade, like pg (snares at the clippers), Kyrie Irving leaving Cavs said he'd like to join the Spurs. I'm not saying we should have forced any trade, I'm just saying we could have made moves, but the fo sat still. Also that atrocious contract pau gasol got, still hunts me till this date. There were some bad decisions made. Patty deserved a raise, but sadly he declined, or couldn't get covered anymore cause or depth was lacking. Maybe this year he will be able to ball out again cause we look to be very defensively oriented with a lot of guys who can switch. We let Kyle Anderson walk but payed Davis a similar amount annually, we let both Simmons and dedmon go, apperently there is a story there. I don't know what it is, but they both signed pretty cheap deals. We were looking to sign someone that summer and pau opted out for that reason. And sure you reward a guy like that, if you end up missing out. With a one year raise. Not a 3 year deal that fucks your entire cap situation. But like I said, this is all my opinion. I feel like we didn't always do the best moves and obviously that happens. But ever since kawhi has been gone, I am actually quite happy with what the Spurs are doing. I was scared they might actually really trade one of those picks for a vet, I'd really hate that. But they really made the most of everything this offseason. If they stopped right now they'd get an a++++ in my books. Some people are claiming they still have some things in the works, I'm not so sure about that.

The fact that he looks like he'll have the potential to switch 3-5, handle the ball some, run in the open court, and shoot 3's is super intriguing. However, he probably needs to put on at least 20 pounds, get better in the post, get better at defensive positioning and clean up his shot. Luckily, I think the spurs have the infrastructure to help out those weaknesses. Not worried about him having defense drilled into him; between Duncan, Robertson, and Aldridge he'll have plenty of help if he need some post up advice; and Chip can probably help his shot some. But he's gonna be slogging it out in Austin for a year at the minimum with what we've seen so far.",07-07-2019,1562535436.0

He also continues to show that he's got an elite nose for the ball, I rarely see him lose battles for loose balls. 

Luka is basically like playdough. He's got a ton of potential but he needs to molded into something. If you just let him do whatever, you don't know what he'll pull out of his bag of tricks. He's a matchup nightmare but he doesn't know which matchups to attack just yet. All in all I'm very excited to see his development, I think I'm alot higher on him than other people in this sub.

nbaspurs,shit,"Its a pretty good synopsis of some major points. I would add that:

1.) there was major beef not just with being able to attract top free agents and make moves to improve the team but a lack of control over what those moves would be. 

2.) Lamarcus is a high usage, ISO heavy player and sharing the load meant taking touches away from Leonard. When Lamarcus asked to be traded, it was, I believe, in part because Kawhi was the face of the team going forward and there was friction between the two of them. When Pop talked him down from the ledge, it was a significant problem for Leonard's group. Especially considering LMA's struggles seemed to be in part due to taking a back seat - and then Zaza happened and suddenly LMA was expected to be the guy again overnight. Letting Simmons go in retrospect was the right move because he hit his ceiling in 2017 and has been at best, a fringe role player since but he was as close to anyone on the team with KL like Danny was. 

3.) Manu and Tony were unwilling to give up leadership of the team. On the court, they facilitated but as vets and champs, they led the locker room - and were a factor in how the Spurs built out the team. Further, the Spurs run their system and while the shade has mostly been low key, there were passive aggressive jabs at the Spurs for the way Toronto was so much more open and suited to KL's playstyle (forgetting the last time he played for the Spurs, they beating the dogshit out of the Death Star in their building on a 62 win season until Zaza happened) 

4.)**the Spurs gonna Spur and spread media and marketing obligations as they see fit and not elevate one player to pursue their brand. And not hire his family into the organization to manage that. 

All that being said, its apparent to me that above all things, KL wanted to be the star and build his brand/legacy. In a way, its somewhat refreshing that he's willing to forego what he would have made signing an extension with the Spurs and that he has gone to great lengths to secure what he wants even over ""the bag"" ....but at the expense of his teammates. 

Sometimes people want to make decisions because they want to be the ones to make the decision and rationalize their way into believing its the best decision. The Spurs are going to do what they do and not for KL or LeBron or KD, or anyone else, cede control or leadership of that vision, which, has produced 22 straight playoff appearances and 5 titles with not lottery picks since 1997 and only one top shelf FA signing. 

I always come back to two points. Manu's status is unquestioned in Spurs fandom. He may well be the most beloved of all Spurs past or present and while he never took a real public stance on this matter, he bled silver and black until the day he retired. Second, the Spurs signed Rudy Gay, a pro, a vet who had been around the league and had been a fringe all-star type player. Rudy, with not career long allegiance to the the Spurs had a front row seat to the saga....then chose to re-sign with the Spurs when he certainly had offers elsewhere for his skill set and having proven his health had mostly returned. 

Bottom line, he wanted out so he could pursue his brand and legacy on his own terms. That in and of its self isn't such a terrible thing but the way he went about it was pretty shitty.",07-08-2019,1562629199.0

Letting Simmons go in retrospect was the right move because he hit his ceiling in 2017 and has been at best, a fringe role player since but he was as close to anyone on the team with KL like Danny was.

IMO signing LaMarcus was objectively wrong in hindsight, I disagree with some of the folks saying he was important to keep the playoff streak, because streaks always end, and we weren't really going any farther than the predictable style of play we have that hinged on LA's skill with nailing tough turnaround jumpers.

But I firmly believe he had no beef with Kawhi being the man. He mentioned repeatedly that he just had to step up, and that Kawhi was going to come back and play with him -- only noting that sharing the leadership duties will be dealt with once the former returned. Alas he did not.

The main issue here I want to address is that Pop and RC didn't get him for who he was but who they wanted him to be. Coach said it himself, he wanted a Jack Sikma type of player. But LA being the vet he is struggled with changing his game and it did no one any favours. Don't get me wrong, he's coachable, and has made great strides with his defence in his four seasons with the Spurs. Dude is fucking scrappy. He tried to switch his offence up for a while, but the inconsistency took a great chunk out of his confidence.

I'd like to add (my humble and useless opinion) that Pop shouldn't have made his comments about the trade request public. It raised some eyebrows, and as you said, a schism -- or more like a precedent. AFAIK, LA didn't reveal that, he just acknowledged the fact when he was asked about it.

I'm also willing to bet they really tried to shop Aldridge but there were no takers after his doodoo sophomore post-season play. Then he saved the next season and the team felt like they still got good value in the man, excellent with the young guys too. He's a great player, my favourite out of the bunch right now, but yes, he was a poor fit. We might not win a ring with him being the main man, but I'm happy he's here with us because he represents the Spurs so well.

Having said all that it didn't seem like it was a major factor in Kawhi's desire to return home.",07-08-2019,1562632733.0

nbaspurs,shit,"I think your bottom line is pretty much spot on. Kawhi wanted out for his own reasons, almost certainly since before the injury drama (I would point to regret over the discount he took to help us sign Aldridge as an underrated factor--Kawhi might value winning over everything, but Dennis certainly doesn't). That would be fine on its own, but he went about leaving in a way that was shitty to the team, fans, players, basically everybody. *shrug* No use re-litigating how that all went down though, I'm pretty much over it.

My new theory though, after how things went down this offseason, is that Kawhi and/or his people had been planing to leave San Antonio since they fired his agent Brian Elfus in 2016 and put Dennis in charge. Elfus negotiated his 2015 contract that helped us have space to sign LMA.

If Kawhi/Dennis/whoever realized in 2016 that like ""Hey, I came second in MVP votes behind Steph Curry, I have the leverage to dictate contract terms to any team in the league, and if they don't keep me happy, then fuck 'em, any team would be lucky to have me"" (which after last week certainly seems to be his mindset now) then the next logical step would be ""Wait, why am I stuck in Texas on a discounted contract for 3 more years? What the fuck Brian??""

nbaspurs,shit,"Masai actually saved the shit out of that trade for us.

Boston wasn't offering Brown, much less Tatum.

Lakers were constructing deals around ONE of Lonzo, Kuzma or Hart. Ingram was not included.

The 76ers offered the same package that Minne got for Jimmy: Bayless, Saric, Covington and a pick.

DeMar just happened to play basically the same position as Danny/Kawhi and had run his course for Toronto. Even Game of Zones made fun of the Jak inclusion, but that guy is going to be very valuable. He may never make an all-star team, or win DPoY, but a mobile/athletic/huge big that is young and has good defensive instincts is very valuable.

Even if Keldon doesn't become an NBA player - which I think he's going to be very good for us - the trade still worked out fine.

Let's look at the Davis, PG13 and Russ deals.

Davis: Lakers were in do-or-die mode. This was the last season they could make their big 3 star play. Davis was still on his lower contract compared to the max he'll sign next year, LeBron is going to be 35 this season and the Lakers cap space disappears next season with either extending Brandon Ingram (had they kept him) and/or extending AD. Last year this wasn't the case for them, so less leverage for SA. NO's knew this and milked them for everything they had, which they could do because they already had the best trade chip in the league outside of *maybe* Giannis - the first pick of the Zion draft.

PG13: Kawhi basically said to Toronto and LAC, if you guys can get either Beal or George, I'll sign. The Clippers also were under the gun. This is what they have been building for, they were willing to trade that massive haul to OKC because they looked at it as not only trading for both Kawhi and PG13, but also keeping Kawhi from signing with the Lakers, which I do think he would've done had neither LAC or TOR gotten another star. Presti knew this and played it beautifully. 

Russ: The return for Russ is yet to be seen if it's better than our return for Kawhi. If they can't get rid of CP3 and end up having to buy him out and stretch his contract, it's arguably a worse deal.

2024 first round pick, protected 1-4: Harden's game will age totally fine, highly unlikely this is a lottery pick.

2026 first round pick, protected 1-4: this one could be in the lottery, but it's still top 4 protected

2025 swap, 1-20 protected: nothing great

2021 swap, protected 1-4 -- OKC can swap Clippers pick or Heat pick. This one could end up ok, swap the likely higher Clippers pick for a marginally lower Houston pick, like pick 26 for pick 22. Good, not great.


Then of course, there's the fact that Kawhi drove his trade value into the dirt. All 3 of these other guys played full seasons. Davis put up insane numbers and was relatively healthy. PG13 came in third in MVP voting, Russ was all-NBA. Kawhi played 9 games, was completely silent and had a mysterious injury.

And lastly, SA wanted to retool, not rebuild. NO and OKC are full on rebuilding, as they should.",07-12-2019,1562973022.0

nbaspurs,asshole,"I have a love/hate relationship with the off season. Part of me want to think that this is a direct result of contract negotiations and discussion over whether or not Demar is worth the max or not. I don't think the Spurs have any interest in giving him a max deal even if they love the guy and feel like he's a key part of the equation going forward. 

If Demar is hesitant to give the Spurs a bit of a discount, they will be more inclined to pick up the phone when it rings and listen. 

Max contracts are weird to begin with, they are a status symbol and badge that indicates you are recognized among the elite more so than actual dollars and cents. Salaries are like a scoreboard to hyper competitive, world class athletes. 

In this context, if the Spurs are reluctant to blow out their future salary cap and as such, are willing to listen to offers....as much as I like Demar, this is the right move. 

Lets be real, a ""team friendly"" deal is still going to be insane, some $25M a year. Not sure how much he's eligible for but he's making $27M-ish now and it will escalate from there.

100 percent correct. Unfortunately, that’s coming this next offseason. If some other team does this, and if Dejounte has the jump in play we all hope this season, he may even be maxed by someone and the Spurs would have to pay $126 mil over 4 yrs to keep him here.

nbaspurs,asshole," Based on skill set and performance, Morris would hypothetically been a key piece but I agree, it was a strange signing, had it happened, based on his track record. 

On one hand, remember, there is a strong contingent of Spurs fans who value the above mentioned over all else and would still swap Patty Mills for Morris if it were a viable trade on the table right now without question. Also, Pop and RC committed to signing him and evidently accepted the inherent risks involved which is generally good enough for me. 

On the other, I agree that I don't really want the asshole and a large part of why was revealed in this episode and the going back and considering what happened and who he was prior to this as well. 

In the end, we gave away Bertans for nothing but we're able to salvage a prospect in Lyles, at least. 2019 Lyles doesn't really help us much and his work ethic is suspect. But he's young and talented so let's see what happens. 

Far as Porzingis goes, I wouldn't be surprised if he reached out to us through his brother, through Davis, and the the Spurs called and inquired...and probably went hard trying to leverage the ""but he says he doesn't want be there"" factor and that pissed them off.

nbaspurs,shit,"I think that's still underrated. Looking at the advanced team numbers from last year and the moves we made this offseason, ""key additions"" is underwhelming until you realize how gaping that hole was last year and how many games it cost us.

Our offense isn't modern, but we're bringing back all of the same players who put up a top 5 offense last season except for Bertans. I don't see any reason to believe that wouldn't continue, barring a huge drop off from Aldridge.

Our defense was absolute dog shit most of the season. There were a couple of two week or month long stretches where we kind of got it together, but it was never sustainable. The reason for that was really obviously the lack of talent defending perimeter players - a surprise breakout sophomore was our only above average defender 1-3, and we had no average defenders who could play the 3-4 spots.

DeMarre Carroll is underwhelming in a vacuum, but he filled this giant gaping wound on our advanced stats page. Then we get the youngest All-Defensive selection ever back as well. If we can maintain that top 5 offense from last year and drag our miserable defense into the top 12 or so, we're going to win a lot of basketball games. 

Even if the rest of the west is competitive, I legitimately believe we'll be #3 or #4 in the conference this season. I can understand why other people are rating us as barely making the playoffs, but I think they're stuck in ""all the west teams have power duos, just rank the power duos"" mode. 

I think as long as Murray and Carroll perform up to expectations defensively, the big picture and trend lines show a different story. Spurs 54 wins #3 seed let's get it on.

EDIT: additional thought - I think we're going to see the kind of jump the Nuggets saw last season. They were due for it the season before, Millsap was their big hole filler (""no pun intended"" - Reggie Miller), but injury issues all season with various players delayed it for a year. At the beginning of last season everyone was like ""where did the Nuggets come from"" but if you go all the way back to the beginning of the '17-'18 season I think you'll find a lot of people saying they would make the playoffs, and before acquiring Millsap it didn't really matter how good Jokic was or how reliable Barton, Harris, and Murray were.

nbaspurs,fuck,"Truth be told, I am so ready to move on. I don’t necessarily forgive him for the way the left, but I am ready for this sub to not always be filled with Kawhi posts. 


However, If he would’ve said this or any reasoning during a season full of rumors, or during/after the trade was going down, all of this would’ve been easier to swallow.

After the trade, when asked why spurs fans booed him on his first game back, he said he figured they would because the Spurs put out a certain narrative and people believe them over the player. Kawhi didn’t give any narrative at all until now.

I don’t care that he’s gone and I understand wanting to be near family, truthfully, but trying to drag the reputation of the organization and the medical staff through the mud just to play in LA is what is harder for me to forgive. I’m sure he felt wronged by the Spurs, but it’s a tough sell saying the most proactive team in the NBA about resting players and trying to be cautious with player health wanted him to risk his career just to play some meaningless playoff games as a 7th seed that we would’ve lost even if a rusty Kawhi was playing. 

He’s still a great player, maybe even the best in the league, but the way he left was frustrating. I’m happy he can see all of the family moments he was missing, I think we can all relate to that. Still, I can’t ever cheer for Kawhi the player the same way again.

We don't need to trade him to get rid of him, again, he is an important piece and while he makes alot of money, he fits with what we have in terms of rookie deals and young studs who could become stars. 

LMA is no Tim Duncan but there were some dark times from 08 to 2012 where we were stuck in the mud and not much better off than we are now in terms of being able to compete and in a much weaker position in terms of assets. The Spurs pivoted from that, in part for drafting (or trading on draft night for) Leonard but even then, he wasn't the elite player he is now, not even when he won FMVP. 

LMA still has value and we can compete with him as a key player but its going to take serious leaps from DJ/Derrick/and/or Lonnie to get there. That's the best timeline. 

All that said, if LMA asks for a trade and we can get value, I would not be opposed. More than anything, I don't want a player who doesn't want to be here and LMA has earned a level of respect and understanding, granted he continues to handle it the right way and not disappear, let his uncle speak for him, and hold us hostage. 

I do not want Hassan Whiteside. He's an asshole but he's about the only thing they have salary wise to match. I'd love CJ McCollum in theory but A.) Portland isn't stupid and B.) we have 46 promising young guards already so he wouldn't really help us. Other than that....Nukic? I guess but we'd still have to eat a shit sandwich salary wise and Portland isn't likely to move heaven and earth to bring 34YO LMA home.",07-29-2019,1564442413.0
