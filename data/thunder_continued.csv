thunder,shit,"It's the western conference and there are no 'easy' series. If it's kings vs GSW 1 v 8 I'm putting a sneaky hundy on the kings. Crazy shit happens, especially in the western conference and especially when you don't expect it.  


That said, I am not scared of any team because I know Russ isn't.

Honestly, fuck the other teams. We've got 14 games left to reach peak thunder, and when that happens it's the other teams that will be scared.

thunder,hell,"Catch and shoot 3 Russ is deadly. Iso 3 Russ still scares the hell out of me.
He doesn't even think about it. Catch and shoot is all muscle memory. In the iso he just locks in on the rim and usually misses long off the back iron. ",03-14-2019,1552596206.0

thunder,shit,Right now it’s just fine. We will see in a few years but hopefully we have a ship by then and will inevitability send Russell out like LA sent Kobe or Wade with Miami. To compare it to some of those dudes above is dumb as shit. ,03-14-2019,1552603972.0

thunder,hell,"Grant has to be better 2 rebounds and 3 points in a 31 minute game is terrible, he was also bad on defense, I wish they'd give Schroder's minutes to Burton, hell let Burton play back up points, Dennis is good once every ten games and terrible the rest of the time",03-14-2019,1552614216.0

thunder,fuck,What will it take for Billy to be fired. How many more times do we have to see him fail at calling timeouts before enough is enough. The man has no fucking clue what he is doing.,03-14-2019,1552613801.0

thunder,dick,"I admit I didn't watch the whole, but saw most the 3rd quarter and the last 3 minutes, and some of y'all are delusional. I agree we've been dicked by refs in previous games, but this wasn't one. We fouled. Alot. It's our own fault we lost the game. First off, pg what are you doing call a timeout. Or Billy, or anyone. We were up 20, and yes they shot lots of free throws, but you can't say they made up a 20 point deficit in a half just solely on bad calls. This loss stings, let's just hope it hurts the players more and they come out and spank the scum because of it",03-14-2019,1552614610.0
thunder,fuck,should have drawn up a fucking play for PG have Russ inbound and keep as many fucking shooters as possible,03-14-2019,1552613599.0
thunder,fuck,"I'm not a Billy hater, but why the fuck does Burton not get in at all, second night of a back to back, athletic, size, can play defense and can shoot. Where as Schroder's just got some quickness, shoots 40%, can't consistently hit open shots, can't stay in front of slower players, can't pass very good, can't contest shots, and really doesn't do anything good to justify getting over 30 minutes a game. Pretty much just a smaller version of Melo aka offensive stopper, not a defensive stopper and a black hole when the ball hits his hand. Hopefully he's off the team next year. 1 good game for every 10 bad ones",03-14-2019,1552617399.0
thunder,shit,This is coaching. Eratic defense in the 3rd Killed us. PG should be gotten that last shot. We suck ass. And we gave up that offensive board to wes Matthews. Fucking pathetic. Fuck this shit. Russ' post shot and that brick 3 killed any momentum in the 4th. Schroder couldn't defend for shit. Ferg fouls alot. ,03-14-2019,1552613748.0
thunder,fuck,"We got fucked over by the refs.

thunder,fuck,"Mother fuckin Billy Donovan! Dumb ass motherfucker! Never shoulda been an NBA coach. He won championships in college because he had multiple future NBA players. Good recruiter I suppose, but motherfucker is no tactician. If we had a real NBA coach... What the fuck are timeouts for? Dumbass motherfucker! ",03-14-2019,1552613970.0
thunder,shit,"I can't believe we lost that, I switched to F1 towards the end of the 3rd quarter expecting us to pull out the win but to see that we lost is a big shock.

The refs were awful but we still should be winning this.

Fully expecting them to say they made a mistake in the L2M report, but that's not going to do shit but annoy everyone.",03-14-2019,1552620063.0
thunder,fuck,"Fuck the Refs. 


Am I doing it right? 


This is a game of runs. They were cold from deep in the first half and really turned it on in the second half. Sabonis played point center and was super impressive. The Pacers play a very balanced team oriented style of ball. You can never count those teams out. 


We shot really well from deep too. 48% is fuckin fire. Our defense got tore up from passing out of the post and team ball. Let’s get back to the Peake for a big game against the Warriors. ",03-14-2019,1552614072.0

thunder,shit,"Pacers fan here. The refs have called a fair game the past few times for our games (including the Sixers loss and our Bucks loss). By fair, I mean shit calls went both ways. There were a few times I said ""Shit that shouldn't be our ball(or shots)."" As a fan you take it though. I counted us out by the end of the 3rd quarter. You guys have a very disconcerting starting 5. As is tradition, thanks for 'Dipo and Domas. I'm actually glad PG is working out for you guys very well. ",03-14-2019,1552614551.0
thunder,fuck,"This loss could’ve 100% been prevented if Billy Donovan had any sort of fucking brain. There is no defending him, leaving schroder in, not calling a timeout and then PG turns it over, letting the overs go on a run of TEN before calling a timeout to stop it. Such a fucking terrible coach.",03-14-2019,1552613624.0
thunder,fuck,Why the fuck are Adams and Schroder in the game on a defensive possession? Billy is a terrible situational coach. Another great game by the refs who have acccounted for about 8 OKC losses,03-14-2019,1552613619.0

thunder,crap,"I agree with you but to me it's not even about the match up. i don't think there's enough difference between the second half of teams. blazers/jazz/spurs - some scrappy teams that we will eventually beat but it will be hard.

The 4 seed is fine. 5 seed, I'd rather not, but again, it probably doesn't make that big a difference. We say we want the 4 seed for homecourt but will only get it in the first round as a 4 seed.

But as a fan sitting in the stands, I have to realize that players wont know that or where I'm coming from. I've never been the type to shout obscenities at players or people, but now I understand how that must feel as a player with a constant spotlight on them being verbally targeted by strangers.

Edit: I actually had some people target me and stalk me at games in highschool to the extent that I had to make a police report -- it turned out that the person doing it (the wife of another coach) was friends with most of the police department. During my report, they cut off the tape recorder and told me they weren't going to file any charges because I described her hair color wrong -- which was some shittty died blonde tipped hair color that suburban step moms always have in the midwest so there were many colors in her hair...

If we played one good quarter a game we certainly wouldnt have 42 wins now would we?

Im tired of this sub crying their eyes out when we have a bad week and then doing a 180 and pretending we're champions when we have a good one. 

We're clearly not trash and we havent proven so far we're going to the finals. But when you were a top 3 seed in the west all year except for the last week that truly says you were consistent and you were good.

- Russ taking a backseat but still averaging a triple double, leads the league in assists

- career highs in every category for 4 of our starters, especially our young players Ferg & Jerami taking the biggest leaps

- finally having solid backups off the bench

but now after a few bad games, we're on track to have a worse seed/record than last year. I'm not saying we're winning it all (nobody outside the Warriors has a chance realistically), but damn, look at teams like Denver and Milwaukee.

Houston won.. 11 wins in their last 12. They got an easy schedule until the end. They got like 2 tough ones against Milwaukee and Denver.

Portland has a very easy schedule as well, only tough games against Denver, maybe against Indiana too, they'll finish the season up with W though.

One game behind us are the Spurs, 8 game winning streak (best in the league). Good thing for us is they'll have to face Golden State, and then Houston, Boston and Denver on the road (they aren't a good road team).

Utah (7-3 in their last 10) other than the last game against Denver will be on a cakewalk going into the Playoffs.

Clippers won at the buzzer. Plz don't let them come close ffs.

Now do you see *real fans* why some of us complained earlier in the season? It's not that we don't like the team, it's because it f'n matters. Even with the easiest schedule we had.. 

Why lose to the Dallas multiple times?

Why lose to the Bulls in Chicago?

Why take two Ls in New Orleans?

Annihilated THREE times from Minnesota.. why? Couldn't you take one game at home at least?

More recently we blew the game against Philly at home who were without two centers, think about it.. shouldn't that have been an easy W?

What about blowing the f'n game in Indiana? That was damn ugly.

... Moving on, regarding tonight's (tomorrow for y'all in the States) game. Miami has been on a roll lately (7-3 in their last 10) losing this game is a big possibility, if we just look on their record and say ""mehh we got them that's light work"" (something we've done a lot this season obviously) we WILL get stomped. They're fighting for their Playoff spot. What do you think they'll just give us the game because they're on a back to back?

thunder,dick,"Why would Russell play like Ben?  One of his main problems is his inconsistent jumper, but it's light years ahead of Simmons.  Russ also needs to limit the dumb turnovers.

IDK what Simmons is doing so great unless you count the fact that being a 6'10 pg has its advantages.  Teams completely ignore Simmons at times.  They literally give this man an ocean of space and play 5 on 4.  Russ is always on the other teams mind.  Embiid being there creates a lot of advantages.  He is also surrounded by better shooters and scorers(Harris, Butler, Embiid, Reddick,).  Our only comparable players are George and Schroder.

I agree there is no variation in our offense.  Embiid and Jokic change defenses because they step out and hit the 3.  Adams clogs the paint and has a tendency to bring the ball down leading help defense to strip him or tie him up.  When Adams decides his action quicker or keeps the ball up he's fine.  We have an offense in the wrong decade.  Seems the Russ and Adams pick and roll is not being used.",03-18-2019,1552957177.0

After Miami didn't score for the first 5 minutes of the game, they never lost composure and seemed to play even harder. I commented on the game thread I wished OKC would play as hard as Miami, because those dude play balls out every possession. Its obviously more complicated than just playing harder, but that would be a good start.

##Oh hell nahh

Did we watch the same Playoff series last April? Like seriously..

*sigh here we go again, repost*

Mistakes during the Utah series below:

Use Grant at the 5 instead of Patterson, he was actually giving Gobert trouble when paired up with him.

As a ""defensive minded coach"" deal with Utah killing us with Horns for 6 games. Blaming Melo is easy, was Melo responsible for them making corner 3s rain? Was it Melo's fault Russell wasn't fighting over screens? Was it Melo's fault Billy's guy Brewer was getting cooked all series long by Mitchell?

How about PG not guarding Mitchell? 

How about refusing to play Melo with the bench?

Felton, Abrines, George, Grant, Patterson -22.2, negatives all across the board in 129 minutes. The same lineup with Melo instead of George was a +1.3 in 37 minutes throughout the season.

How about him not changing our offense after seeing how Utah defended our pick n roll? He wanted the players to figure it out themselves? Did they figure it out or did we get bounced in the the 1st round? 6 games and he refused to do something about us getting killed.

>We have a group that passes more. 

Lmaooo that was a good one.

More than who? We're last in passes in the league by a lot! Just like last season (we actually passed more last season lmao), and the season before that one, and the previous one. Hmmm 🤔🤔🤔 check that one out. With Billy coaching we're dead last in passes made.

You mention Stevens, that's funny.. Stevens was in the Conference Finals with his team missing their best 2 players. How do you think this team would look without Westbrook and George right now?

>You guys like Brett Brown but Philly won 50 games last year and choked in the Playoffs...shit we can do that too.

No actually we can't, we haven't won 50 games after KD left. The way things are going at the moment we probably won't do it this season either sadly. And even if they choked in the Playoffs as you said (btw they hadn't been in the Playoffs in 6 years.. team with almost zero Playoff experience) they did it in the second round. We have been first round exits lately.",03-19-2019,1553031900.0

&#x200B;

I will back this up by saying it is the casual attitude that we had when we were playing all of these 'lesser teams'.  It's almost as though we thought we already had the game won before the game even began.   Yes any team (including the Golden State Warriors) could lose to a shit team during the season but it is also the WAY we are losing to this team.  Holy shit we don't learn from this.

&#x200B;

>This is why the Thunder has not nor will nor do anything the way it's constructed--coach, roster, whatever. We are not a team that can take care of business like other professional teams can, and 16 bad losses based on quality of opponent or context (giving up a 20 point lead to an Oladipo less Pacers team on the road) prevents a team from advancing in the playoffs from the 5 seed compared to a team that only has *10* bad losses and gets the 2 seed.

&#x200B;

Again, it is almost the casual attitude that we have that causes us to give up a 20 point lead in games.

&#x200B;

Also time after time we see our 10+ point leads not only getting reduced to 0 but we end up trailing the game because Billy Donovan wouldn't call a timeout to reassess.  An example of good coaching was shown against us in several games this season and I will take Nick Nurse as an example:  When the Raptors had their lead reduced from 18 point lead to 11 point lead, he immediately called a timeout to stop our momentum to draw up plays to counter this. And straight up from the timeout, the Raptors went on a 6-0 run immediately and off-set our comeback run.   What would Billy Donovan do in that situation? Nothing.  He's too scared to pull players off the court for doing dumb shit and we cannot have this as our coach.  He's not supposed to be MATES with the players, he's supposed to be the coach to ensure that we practice hard and play good basketball and win games.  Out of the 3 criteria that I have just listed, how many do you think we have done so in the past month?  None would be the correct answer.   Did you see how many free throws we missed today?  Did you see how many intercept passes that we threw today?  Did you see how many times we did not move the ball but instead decided to take contested shots today?  Did you see how we could not close the game late in the 4th quarter when we had the chance to?

&#x200B;

Fuck this seriously. Just take half our roster and sign KD and some young guns.  We need some shooters.

&#x200B;

And also fire Billy.  Maybe fire Presti too.  We need to win a chip and it is almost laughable now that we have the highest payroll in the NBA and we can't even get to the WCF, let alone finish in the top 3 of the Western Conference.",03-21-2019,1553148778.0

If the rest of the team would at least be consistent in effort and make the final play with confidence, at least come late April, we can definitely make it out of the first round. Just watching Schroeder and Ferguson run around in circles on the last play with Russ deciding to hand over the ball to the team on the last overtime play shows it.

There is no shame in losing to the Raptors at home, or the Pacers on the road, or the Sixers at home.  You can't win them all.  

And you're going to have the occasional bad loss, all teams do.   

However, I am sick and tired of this lackadaisical attitude that this franchise, it's coach, it's players, and the self righteous fans here have toward taking care of business.  

It's one thing to lose to the Bulls on the road.  

It's another thing to lose to the Bulls *and the Hawks* on the road.  

It's one thing to lose ones it the TWolves at home.  It's another thing to lose *two games to the TWolves at home*.   

It's one thing to lose to the Wizards at home.  It's another thing to lose to the Wizards *and* the Lebron-less Lakers at home.  

It's one thing to lose to the Nuggets at home, a good team.  It's another to lose to to the Nuggets, Raptors, Celtics, Clippers, Kings, Heat, etc at home.  

Go out, and win *half* of the bad losses.  Do that, and we're the 2 seed on track to a WCF.  If something funky happens to the Warriors, we can make the NBA Finals.  

(Which is another thing that drives me nuts.  The Mavs on 2011, the Heat in 2006, the Pistons in 2004, the Cavs in 2016, all weren't supposed to win the title that year.  Yet they did.  Each for various reasons--injuries, whether major or minor (Curry's ankle in 2016), or locker room dysfunction (Lakers in O4) or inconsistent chemistry among star players (Heat in 11).  Yet...those teams won titles.  How odious will it be if we fail to get out of the first round--because of regular season ineptitude, whatever the cause of it--and the Rockets, Nuggets, Bucks get that precious NBA title because the Warriors screwed it up somehow).  

There is no ""whelp, lace em up and get em next time, Thunder up!"" when we lose in December to the Bulls on the road.  No.  Go out and when *your fucking games* that you're supposed to.  Yeah, the occasional WTF loss happens.  The Thunder doubles down, triple downs on those that the competitors don't.  

The Rockets lost tonight to a bad team.  Ok.  They still have 3 more wins than we do, 3 wins earned by cutting back those bad losses.  

This is why the Thunder has not nor will nor do anything the way it's constructed--coach, roster, whatever.

Get mad next year when we have two bad losses in November instead of one.  Get mad in December when we have four bad losses instead of two.  Get mad on January when we have six bad losses instead of three.   Get mad in February when we have eight bad losses instead of four.  And get mad in March when we having finished the month and we are pushing sixteen bad losses instead of eight.  Because the staff and players aren't.  ",03-21-2019,1553143950.0

I've always been high on Grant.  Last year, he went from timid to a monster literally over night.  I honestly thought he was done growing after last season for the most part.  I figured he would be a 10 pt/night shooter and that was it and for me that was good enough. 

This year, especially through the last two games, I feel like he has broken through another glass ceiling.  Watching him shoot the threes tonight, he's so collected, doesn't rush, and just let's it fly.  It hit me tonight that he's a legit threat and if opponents don't respect him, he will burn them on the perimeter or the drive. 

Yes, he need the ball more until other teams try to shut him down.  With him and Ferg hitting their shots, I think this team will fuck teams and their wives if the opponents leave any option open on the starting line.

My conspiracy time to shine:

1) the NBA is a business that needs to make money and knows that OKC needs to play GSW to bring more revenue

2) Westbrook took the beginning of the season off so PG could carry the team. Now, PG has the rest of the season off since Russ doesnt run out of juice but PG needs rest.  Come playoffs, both will be phenomenal. 

3) Michael's Secret Stuff 

And probably my favorite one I've thought of:

4) Billy really does have a book of secret plays. He plays the same regular shit over and over in the regular season to get teams used to our rotations and plays. We do just enough to get in the playoffs then BOOM, we change everything up to throw the opponent off.

thunder,shit,"The issue with Stevo is, he’s just the same guy. He’s added a floater / hook which is really handy (literally) but that’s it. He’s kept on being the same traditional big with a hook shot and not much else. It doesn’t help much that Russ is such a shitty shooter and can be sagged on too. 

Because until Russ can shoot again. The Russ/Adams pick and roll is dead which was most of Steve’s PPG.  

The biggest flaw is his over rated defensive skill set. Stevo creates defense by being a pretty intimidating presence inside. But he doesn’t actually play much D really. And can not guard the elite perimeter bigs. He doesn’t block many shots, he gets steals here n there but isn’t really shutting centred down. 

I’m not off him and I’m not as extreme as those that want him traded any time we lose but at the same time, perhaps 5/100 million was a bit much when Capela got less despite being better on D. 

We either need to start seeing some elite D from him, or a more refined offensive game because 20 million a year for limited offense and barely satisfactory defense from a 7”0 270 lb guy is pretty mediocre ",03-25-2019,1553572659.0

Sucks for Noel.  IMO I've enjoyed our teams effort more with him on the court than Adams lately.  Noel is just so fucking good at defending hte pick and roll.  And he tries so hard.

thunder,shit,"I've been saying this for the whole year essentially, most of our issues come down to 3 things imo, discipline, execution, and a sort of weird arrogance this team has had issues with for a few years when facing ""bad"" teams.

On discipline, you already covered most of it, but one night you'll have Russ fighting over every single screen, staying extremely disciplined, and defending at a high level like he was versus toronto, or you'll have Memphis where *literally* the first possession of the game we see a backdoor cut behind russ as hes ballwatching for an open layup. That sets the tone for the entire team and the entire game, and it's not a great way to be consistent. [Possession i mentioned](https://twitter.com/JonMHamm/status/1110376741825138691)

On execution, i think it ties into discipline, but it's mostly executing either the defensive scheme or the game plan. We've seen a lot of lapses in communication or focus from every player on the team. Pre ASB we were 10th in open shots generated with 4 feet or more, and post asb we are 5th. We were shooting 34 percent on them pre asb, now shooting 26%. We aren't making shots, which is a huge issue, but i think it obviously goes beyond that as well. We've seen a large defensive drop off, we've seen a way more iso heavy style of play that isn't paying off, and we've seen a team that struggles to engage defensively unless they are hitting shots. The guys need to defend regardless if shots are falling, and you see them lose a bit of that motivation when they are missing.

Lastly, they're doing the classic thunder bullshit of playing hard against great teams, and then lazily coming out against bad teams, disrespecting them with lack of effort, realizing too late its an NBA team, and losing.

One last aside, PG's pre and post ASB numbers are staggering. He was +11 in net rating pre asb, and is a *-2* post asb. His TS has dropped from nearly 60% to 52%, his 3 point percentage from 40.2% to 32.3%, and hes dropped from 45.6% from the field to 38.6%.

Thats a *huge* drop off, and his absurd numbers pre asb were masking some of these other issues we had. To have any chance for reasonable playoff success, PG has to return to a semblance of what he was.

 ",03-27-2019,1553713775.0
thunder,fuck,"> Home run plays

This is something I've noticed as well. Thunder will claw back from a 15 point deficit to be down 2 and gamble on a full court alley oop pass that would completely swing the momentum if it worked, but fuck us over if it didn't.

Russ/PG will take a ""fuck you"" three in similar situations to try to completely flip the momentum in their favor but it just sucks when it clanks.

And this one is on BD as well, but no play calls. Billy's secrit playbook is literally:

1. Russ ""fuck you"" three

2. PG ""fuck you"" three

3. PG ""fuck you"" drive into the basket and take a contested layup against 3 defenders

4. Grant ""fuck you"" drive into the basket and take a contested layup against 3 defenders

5. Adams ""fuck you"" hook shot

6. Drive, kick, drive, kick, drive, kick, drive, kick, oh, no more time on the shot clock? Dennis ""fuck you"" three",03-27-2019,1553706944.0
thunder,shit,"It's hard to pin that on Billy honestly. Earlier in the year we saw tons of ball movement and off ball movement. We had the most shot attempts with 5 feet of space or greater in the league pre asb. I definitely don't think Billy or *any* coach for that matter would suggest the best play is Russ taking a shitty early shot clock pull up 3. This has been an issue his entire career, and it's only exacerbated by being down in a game.

Ultimately I think some of the role players are getting a little tired of running around only to not get the ball. It's not that encouraging to expend a ton of effort to run through a bunch of defenders for an open shot only to have Russ or pg stare at the hoop with single minded determination to score themselves. I think our leaders need to do a way better job of setting up their teammates, like we saw in the raptors game. ",03-27-2019,1553712916.0

Adams also got hurt in that same window and for whatever fucking reason, Billy (and Sam) have done a horrible job of managing his minutes. He's worn down and has really stunk for the entire month.

Adams was terrible in the 2nd half. PG should sit the rest of the year, they can't beat anyone without him playing like an MVP. Thunder will lose in 5 or 6 with him playing injured against any team in the West.

Thunder bench is one of the worst I've ever seen, Noel's defense is the only aspect of it that isn't pure garbage. Nader's terrible, Burton's not ready, Morris is worse than PPat, if that's possible, Schmelo is worst than the og Melo, Noel can't catch a pass or do anything on offense, PPat and Ray shouldn't see garbage minutes.

In NBA many teams plays efficient offense without having a 3pt shooter center.

WB+Adams surrounded by 3 good shooters.

This roster is fine. Thunder wasnt much worse with Robertson on the wing anyway.

thunder,fuck,"http://tradenba.com/trades/B19sD_3_4

This past summer I was so against this trade because I expected Adams to improve and I don't trust Love with his health but at this point.. gotta try something different. Still think the Cavs would want more picks but our pick situation is kinda fucked.

http://tradenba.com/trades/ryxfw_2dV

Of course the Pelicans laugh their ass off and hung up the phone but gotta shoot your shot lmao.

http://tradenba.com/trades/HklGF_huN

I don't expect any big free agent to end up on Phoenix, maybe Dennis is what they're looking for in the Point Guard position,

I legit can't think of any other trade at the moment.. might as well look at some other possibilities.

**Rodney Hood:** he would be a good addition to the team, especially if we trade Ferguson. Good scorer to have even though he'll take his isos from time to time.

**Derrick Rose:** Yessir that's the guy some of y'all had out of the league last summer, if we use him right (doubt that Donovan does) he could give us 17-18 and 6 from the bench, especially if we bring more shooters which would help our transition game, something Derrick loves.

Which brings me to **Wesley Matthews:** not only he can shoot, he can also play defense. I also believe we can use him as a backup SF to rest PG. Perfect player for us.

**Wayne Ellington:** No guys, he can still splash despite the 36% from 3 in Miami this season, he's shooting 41% in Detroit. His defence isn't that good which means he'll likely be a bench player here. But think about this, we managed to be one of the best defensive teams last season with Melo playing 30 minutes per game, I think we can handle Ellington.

thunder,hell,"Replace Donovan with David Blatt

Noel is unfortunately gone...we're way over and I doubt we can find a way to pay him what he's worth.  Robin Lopez would be a nice defensive addition if he's willing to sign for cheap for a year or two.  Maybe we can sell him on the idea of playoff basketball.

In addition to Noel, you've got Felton, and Morris, and probably PPat coming off the books.  Felton might resign for a bag of Doritos since he plays like 43 minutes a season now....I'd keep him for a vet min just for his presence.  Morris I really wanted to fit in, but I wasn't sold on the signing.  So far it looks like he doesn't really fit in with this team.  I'd let  him walk.  PPat as much as I wanted to see him succeed is a lost cause.  Let him walk too.

Letting those two walk you'll need another PF who can shoot: draft a young prospect and work him in quickly and hope for the best.  Can't afford any of the big names this offseason.

Roberson should be back, so hopefully he's able to bounce back well and return to at least 90% of his former form quickly.

The other big hole is more consistent shooting. There's a ton of 3 and D type guys and some pure scorers from smaller markets that might be possible to either sign&trade or just sign flat out for 1yr, I'd go after one of the following: Terrence Ross, Jeremy Lamb, Gerald Green, or in a perfect world Danny Green.

Now for the controversial/downvote getter : I'd trade Adams.  He's a great guy, he's funny, charming, and he grabs rebounds.  I get it.  But he's also had a loooong streak of defensive lapses, and also just getting outplayed by not only the other star centers, but also scrubs.  Can't guard the pnr either.  Basically everything we said about Kanter when we were so willing to get rid of him.

It'll be a downer, but his salary is a killer.  We're not good enough to compete for a championship, and can't sign the 3nD guys we really need, nor attract a 3rd ""star""...hell, we can't even keep Noel.  That 25mil is going to ensure that we're perpetually a 48win team that at best can look forward to losing in the 2nd round and at worst 8th seed getting beat in the 1st round.

thunder,hell,"I don't know how many times I've posted this but I'll continue until the Billy Defense Force stops the he coaches in the Playoffs.. repost below.

Mistakes during the Utah series:

Use Grant at the 5 instead of Patterson, he was actually giving Gobert trouble when paired up with him.

As a ""defensive minded coach"" deal with Utah killing us with Horns for 6 games. Blaming Melo is easy, was Melo responsible for them making corner 3s rain? Was it Melo's fault Russell wasn't fighting over screens? Was it Melo's fault Billy's guy Brewer was getting cooked all series long by Mitchell?

How about PG not guarding Mitchell? 

How about refusing to play Melo with the bench?

Felton, Abrines, George, Grant, Patterson -22.2, negatives all across the board in 129 minutes. The same lineup with Melo instead of George was a +1.3 in 37 minutes throughout the season.

How about him not changing our offense after seeing how Utah defended our pick n roll? He wanted the players to figure it out themselves? Did they figure it out or did we get bounced in the the 1st round? 6 games and he refused to do something about us getting killed.",03-31-2019,1554078855.0

thunder,fuck,"I actually can see that being true after all the comments the guys make about Billy, I like your thought, but please.. please do not ever EVER compare them to LeBron. Because he at least wins. He has more Finals appearances only in his Miami stint than Westbrook and George combined. So I can see Bron wanting things to go his way because they work.

And if that's the case they need an ego check as well. Don't know if it will be Billy, Sam bring the fucking owners to be like LOOK BITCHES WE AIN'T PAYING ALL THAT FUCK MONEY FOR FIRST ROUND EXITS. You either play winning basketball or you're off to Cleveland, have fun with iso ball there.

Back to our head coach now..

>That could even extend to timeouts, where they may not want Billy to call them because they feel like they are good enough to turn the momentum around themselves. What I am saying is that Billy might not necessarily be a bad coach, but it’s ridiculously hard to handle the personalities and egos of Russ and PG.

Doesn't this mean that he has lost control of what it's supposed to be his team? Which means he doesn't do his job properly.. which also means he should be fired. Can you imagine people showing up at work flipping off their boss and telling him ""this is what we gonna do"". What does that say for them and for the boss? 

Think about it. Maybe our locker room isn't as good as we think after all..",04-01-2019,1554131220.0
thunder,hell,"I think all of them are true.

Donovan is a good coach, just look at his college record.  To assume he's bad is asinine.  That being said: good only gets you so far.  We need a great coach.  Great coaches lead men to championships.  He can excel in college, but he's clearly not the guy for this particular NBA team...possibly no NBA team from what I've seen.

That being said, Morris doesn't fit this team.  His defense isn't nearly good enough and his shooting is so-so at best.  If it were Marcus I'd be ecstatic, but I've never been big on Markeif.

Shroeder I think is a good pickup and I've never been down on him even when everyone else was calling for him to be traded for a bag of chips.  He does make some questionable decisions, but then again Russ makes several more and we still love him for it because he can will us to victory on a good day.  I like to give Schroeder the same courtesy.  For us to make a run in the postseason we'll need more consistency from him.

I don't pay Adams salary so I can't personally say he's overpaid with any certainty; compared to some other centers he's probably about right salary wise if I'm being honest.  He's making less than Jokic, Drummond, and Embiid and rightfully so...but he's also making less than Horford, Whiteside, and Gasol...so he's not *the most* overpaid comparatively speaking.  He does make a ton more than Nurkic, Lopez,  and Capela though...and in that light he's overpaid relatively speaking considering what he brings to the table.  Either way, overpaid or not: he's been a defensive liability the last half of the season.  Come the playoffs guards are going to feast on him in the PnR.  Skilled centers destroy him on a nightly basis too.

&#x200B;

I don't know how much of Donovan's failings are on WB or PG being ""uncoachable"" but I do know there was that report about the two of them telling Donovan they don't want him to bother calling plays for them.  Maybe it's true, maybe it's not.  Either way Donovan is a pushover if he's going to allow his players to dictate all the playcalling.  I doubt it's Donovan's playcalling to allow for Russ to pull up for a heatcheck 3 with 1:28 left in the game.  I also doubt his game plan is for the ball once it crosses halfcourt to be passed ONCE, then whoever has it dribbles for 5-8 seconds and then takes a contested pull up jumper.  There's no ball movement, no extra passes.  It's always one guy dribbles the ball up court, passes to another...and whoever gets that first pass shoots the ball 90% of the time.  Doubt Donovan has that in mind for the game plan, but even if not he definitely lost the team some time ago.  

&#x200B;

Presti has done a good job IMO, hell..he got us PG after losing KD.  Things could've gotten really bad but fortunately Presti knows what he's doing and ownership is willing to foot the bill.  The big problem becomes when you're the highest paid team, with millions of $ going to luxury tax bills year after year...and you get bounced in the first round.  What usually happens after that is the owners decide they're tired of paying through the nose for an avg team and they decide to cheap out for a couple years.  That's when the real problems start.  As is, right now we're good enough to guarantee a playoff berth, but at best 2nd round exit, at worst 1st round sweep.",04-01-2019,1554099226.0

The addition of Taj Gibson was awesome. Turning a lackluster Oladipo and rookie Sabonis into Paul George. Turning Kanter and McDermott into Melo (hindsight is 20/20 but Portland and Houston were both fighting for him as well). Convincing Russ to sign his extension and bringing PG back. He is capable of doing amazing things. 

With that being said he has also made decisions that make you want to slam your head into the wall. Decisions that are detrimental to keeping up in this conference. Obviously we are unlucky to have Russ and PG in their primes during the GSW era but we should be sniffing the WCF every season in my opinion.

That's a pretty fair question that would get asked in any market. Felton gave a pretty thoughtful answer to the same type of question. It's fine that not every guy is going to give a great interview, but it shouldn't be surprising that Russ being surly with the media is going to rub people the wrong way.

Someone not long ago posted PG's stats on contested 3s before and after the All-Star break. Paul playing like an MVP is what got Billy an extension/option whatever we did to keep him. He got rewarded despite all the issues we have. Is it a coincidence that the team after hiring Billy has been dead last in passes made every season?

thunder,fuck,"I think there are a couple main reasons people want to play the Warriors first round.

1) If we lose in the first round it matches their narrative of fire billy for not getting out of the first and playing the Warriors maximizes those chances. 

2) If we’re going to lose in the first round anyway, it might as well be to the favorites to win it all. No faith in the team to beat the Nuggets. 

3) Fuck the Warriors, lets fuckin go. No need to play them later in the playoffs if we can beat them in the first. 

4) Maybe we catch them sleeping in the first round before they’ve fully implemented playoff mode. Our best chance to beat them. 

5) So we finally get a KD v Russ playoff matchup.

People just have a prejudice towards him because of his aggressive personality and competitiveness. As for the “stat padding”, I can’t find the source (if someone can link it, that would be great), but it statistically, when Westbrook grabs the rebound, OKC have better possessions/ score more, because it speeds up the game, as Adams can already be running down the court, and it gives okc a head start. People don’t appreciate how insane this guy is, he is literally average a triple-double for the 3rd season in a row. Only one person has ever averaged a triple double in a season, ONCE. Westbrook did it not once, not twice, but three times, and in a row. This is such bullshit man.",04-08-2019,1554756278.0

I know the first year wasn’t his fault. But losing last year to a rookie Donovan Mitchell led jazz team while having PG, melo and adams was pretty sad.

We lost Abrines and never got Robes back, we don’t need to blow fuck all up we just need to make some tweaks in the off season to sure up positions and we will be right in the mix next year especially if the Warriors fall apart with KD going to Knicks or elsewhere.

thunder,hell,"i feel like Devon Energy or Midfirst Bank could have sponsored them, hell maybe even Sonic",04-11-2019,1554955677.0

thunder,fuck,"Bro I learned something today and yesterday. Portland fans fucking hate us! Lol I thought only Houston could spew out that much crap, but wow.  There are a ton of bitter fans over there that just abhor us. Apparently, Westbrook is a dirty trashtalker who would never let Portland live it down if we beat them?",04-10-2019,1554954281.0

thunder,shit,"Good news: we’re the lower seed, so a first round exit is actually expected. If we win, it’s a “good job OKC.”

Bad news: you’re the higher seed, and you will likely lose to the Jazz in 5. Gobert will own you. And it’ll be yet ANOTHER year of not doing shit in the playoffs.",04-10-2019,1554954527.0
thunder,bitch,A Blazers fan talking about 1st round exits? FOH. Your team is bitch made and full of pussies. Y'all are running a 6 man rotation of G-leaguers just to avoid us in the 1st round when you could've gotten 3rd seed and avoided GSW till the WCF. Gobert and Mitchell are going to destroy you guys as well so why tf are you here?,04-10-2019,1554954573.0
