torontoraptors,bitch,"From the 4th quarter to the end of OT 10 fouls were called on the Raptors, Tony Brothers called 8 of them. ([unless I counted wrong feel free to look here](https://stats.nba.com/game/0021801072/playbyplay/)). Just crtl+F foul and then scroll to the 4th q. I'm not saying all of them are not fouls but some of them definitely weren't. 

edit: it's pretty clear this is a divisive topic. I won't post a vid here but here's some more info on why it seemed like Tony boned us so hard. I already mentioned Tony called 8 fouls on the Raptors in the 4th and OT. In the rest of the game, he only called 3 on the raps (2 in the 2nd, 1 in the 3rd). Any bitching about the refs up until the 4th would have probably been criticism of their collective effort, including no calls which you can't really blame an individual ref for. So once OKC begins to make their comeback Tony starts blowing like crazy. I believe he called 5 fouls against the Thunder in 4th/OT, bringing his total count to 13 fouls called. I think this guy is just not good at his job.

We match up good with Philly, and in terms of Embiid counter's who tend to be traditional big men we probably have one of the best remaining traditional bigs left in the game in Gasol. redick gets all this praise but no one even talks about Danny G who can shoot the ball just as well and is a fa superior defender than redick.

No. He has no reason to do that right now. He's going to wait and see what RFA offers he can get. To do otherwise simply makes no sense for him. He's going to win MIP. If he plays good next season he's going to want to ""cash in"" (relatively speaking). ",03-21-2019,1553185996.0

What worries me though is when Siakam starts playing with the bench at the end of the 3rd if he makes one mistake he seems to be frozen out, fucking Lin and Powell have the ball a bit too much and then pascal rests at the end of the 3rd and rarely gets it when he comes back in the 4th also.

torontoraptors,shit,"You cannot compare players just because they share the same “purpose” or position. Why? First, because players have different weaponries or skill sets. Hence, they will impact the game differently. Secondly, players belong in different echelons. Naïveté aside, there’s levels to this shit. You cannot conflate and compare players from different hierarchies (role players vs all-stars vs superstars). Lastly, players may share the same position, but they could have different playing styles. In this case, JV is a FINISHER. Meaning, when you give the ball to JV, he would shoot it. Consequently, JV will have more raw production. Translating into a much more impressive stat sheet. Whereas with Gasol, when he gets the ball, his versatility allows him to make plays for his teammates or score the ball. As a Raptor, his playmaking is much more paramount to the team’s success, because the Raptors have so many offensive weapons already.

The TRUTH hurts. There are too many people that cant see what is right in front of them. JV is better than Gasol. Our team was better with JV than Gasol.

1. Memphis became a lottery team because they could not win with Gasol.

2. If JV were there from the start based on their recent run they likely would be competing for a playoff spot. They beat Houston just the other day LEAD by JV while we got swept by the Pistons lost to the Cavs and Orlando..

3. Compare the two players objectively....even with Serge injured Marc can barely scrape up a double double.. 

4. Our team needs another reliable scorer to take the load off Kawhi and Paskal....right now we go thru droughts(pretty much the scouting report of the league on our team) and the ball movement is great but ultimately no one is able to put the ball in the bucket....
 ",03-23-2019,1553322177.0
torontoraptors,shit,"1. Memphis became a lottery team because their front office sucks and couldn't put high level players around Marc and Mike to succeed

2. Winning one close game against the Rockets does not mean they'd make the playoffs if they had JV the whole time. The Cavs beat us the other week with Love back in the lineup, if they had him the whole year would they have made the playoffs? 

3. Marc isn't the strongest rebounder and without a guy who's excellent at it that'll definitely be a problem. However, the amount of ball movement and open looks Marc creates is worth his personal lack of scoring. He can still get buckets if he needs to, I'm sure that'll be an emphasis as we near the playoffs

4. Fred can also create his own shot and don't act like Lowry doesn't have the ability to go for 25 or 30. JV could not create his own shot better than Marc could, and was only getting a dozen points a game anyways, which Danny has been able to get with his shooting.

JV is currently putting up huge numbers on a shitty Memphis team but wasn't averaging a double double for us. What we needed was stronger paint defence and smarter offensive players and Marc fits that perfectly.

I was like “how the hell did he get there??” But it’s awesome, I think he hangs out in LA most summers and through mutual connections or agents or whatever I think he got connected to those groups.

Plus all the Rico Hines work, I think most players spend a week or two at a Rico Hines camp but  Siakam basically spent his entire summer there and would have played with and against everybody.",03-23-2019,1553392458.0

torontoraptors,shit,"I’m kind of over talking it over with some of the people in this sub about Lin. My perspective was that he was on the team and you should root for one of your own player to succeed. I’ve heard many takes of why there was a struggle when he first came and some were very valid and me personally, I’m still craving for a 2 guard bench back court of Lin and FVV but with Lowry out and Kawhi load management it’s been almost impossible to see it. But I think there are some so turned off by him and have a negative bias towards him because of his poor performance when he first came and all the crazed Lin fans over hyping him. I don’t know how to fix that part but I just look at what people are saying and if I feel like it’s bullshit I disregard it. I’m still rooting for Lin success because his success is the Raptor’s success and there’s no telling what’s up ahead and he may be an important piece that the team may need to rely on so it’s better to be hopeful about him.",03-23-2019,1553366958.0

He's not getting minutes once Lowry is back.

I love how nobody on these sub yes specifically only these sub makes a Gasol posts or mention of him underachieving since the trade everytime we lose. The guy has been playing terrible ever since we traded for him sure he would make some beautiful passes/assists here and there but where is he when we need someone to step up on offense?. The guy hasn't even scored 20 pts since he came here but nobody bats an eye instead Lin  gets all the hate as if everyone expected him to play like an all-star. 

Like wtf is wrong with this sub?. I wonder why this  sub always hate on Lin not everyone but majority does.  Is this sub full of ______ people?


Gasol is the one that got traded for JV whose been playing pretty well, also traded for Delon weight and CJ miles. Ive seen a lot of comments, and they bring up those 3 and Lin together which has nothing to do with them being traded away. ",03-23-2019,1553366197.0

But man that shot was absolutely incredible. You don’t see many shots like that as a fan, and it’s always fun to witness it when you know this loss doesn’t mean anything to us in the long run, and the fact we played hard is good enough for me. 

Add to the fact this Charlotte team really really needed that win to keep their hopes alive.

torontoraptors,fuck,"* If last night was a test or a competition between our role players to see who's going to play in the Playoff, Lin failed. He played 6 minutes and Nurse already saw enough. -8 in 6 minutes... I don't know what's happening to him, but he needs to find something in him in the next 8 games.
* OG is clumsy has fuck and just seemed to play without confidence last night. He drained his first, was playing good defense and then he took a bad Step-Back shot and that was it. He was passing on Catch N'Shoot he was usually taking. Nevertheless, he's so big that we simply can't not play him in the playoff, it will be interesting to see how Nurse manages him.
* Norm just made a huge argument to play him in the playoffs. I've been saying it throughout FVV's injury, Norman Powell becomes Norm ""The God"" Powell when he plays with FVV. He needs his steady attitude to counter his emotional playstyle. Norm is a great role player when he isn't the one tasks with creating for others.
* Siakam and Kawhi had great nights like I expected. They are beautiful to watch go-to-work together. Awesome shoes by Kawhi too! New Balance has made him a pair of shoe embracing Raptors culture. Makes me hope that they didn't put a clause in Kawhi's contract that he gets a bonus if he ends up in L.A or NY like Lebron had.
* Marc Gasol! That men was on fire! That is the player we traded for, he was great last night.
* FVV was feasting against the other team bench like we expected.

\-----

* Kemba has some of the cleanest handles in the league. There was a sequence in the 2nd where he dribbled through Lowry then Kawhi like they were ghost. He's a very impressive player to watch.
* WHO THE FUCK IS BACON? 

It was a great 1st and 4th quarter but a boring 2nd and 3rd quarter. This game really felt like a practice, everyone on the bench had around 10 minutes to prove themselves (except Lin). They we're trying new looks in their Zone defensive schemes. I loved that small ball lineup we closed the game with. What made GSW so dangerous (besides their ability to shoot the 3 better then everyone else) is their ability to switch to a small lineup and still dominate defensively the other team. We have the personal to effectively play a Small Ball Lineup and it was fun to watch!

Lastly, in 70 years when a kid will ask Jeremy Lamb about his most memorable shot in the NBA, yesterday's shot is probably what he's going to say. It took an impossible shot to beat us in a game where we spent half the game coasting and trying out stuff. I'm not mad nor anxious, just impressed by our team 4th quarter performance and that final shot!",03-25-2019,1553523851.0

That's it for me. I get happier thinking of the good times rather than dwelling on the bad. So much of this team's history is shit, so why focus on one of the negative parts of it rather than the good stuff. 

So many fans much rather feel like they need to carry the anti-vince flag as a way of showing their superiority as ""real fans"". 

I bought a ticket from a scalper to go boo Vince on his first game here. I hated him for years. But holding on to hate is dumb.

torontoraptors,fuck,I honestly think he has an extreme case of the yips. This has happen to a lot of athletes across different sports when they face stress and adversity. I think he bought into the hype of coming to Toronto and having a huge Asian community watching him here and living up to expectation. There’s no excuse now for not knowing plays or getting acclimate to the team but I think he’s legit scared to shoot now. When shots don’t go in over and over it starts to fuck with your confidence. Coming in he had respectable stats that were NBA level but something not really known was he had the highest percentage mid range right jump shot from the paint in the league at the time. Yeah he didn’t have a high volume but from that spot he was money. I think his confidence is crushed almost completely and he’s out there trying to force it.

The sixers: Embiid can be a beast. Gasol does perform good against him, but JV was holding real estate in that guy head. Embiid talk shit against anyone, I never seen him as quiet as when he plays JV. If for some reason he end up being the difference if we lose against the sixers that will hurt a lot.

The warriors: basically the same reason than for the sixers, but because of Cousins. I don’t think it matters as much as for the sixers tho because having Gasol being able to close out lanes and anticipate should be better than what JV brought inside.",03-31-2019,1554044628.0

* ""Lou Williams was a key free agent."" - And?
* I have no idea why this dude is randomly taking shots at Pop, the best coach in NBA history.
* FVV will very likely never be the player that Kyle Lowry is.
* ""Siakim"" - Sigh.
* ""Green has said he wants to re-sign"" - Has he?? If he has, can someone link me, because I have never once heard that.
* ""McCaw is a nice young piece"" - I highly doubt Kawhi gives a fuck about whether Patrick McCaw re-signs.
* ""905 are a threat again in the G League"" - See above.
* ""Building an average team and hoping to win with that because you are in LA through getting the top free agents shows that you can't find consistent replaceable talent."" - What the fuck does this even mean?
* ""Masai, by far is the best NBA leader of a franchise"" - I fucking love Masai, he is certainly not the best 'by far'.
* Trading for Kobe was the Lakers' last best move? Erm... No it wasn't. The Gasol trade was a heist, and I can think of several other more minor solid moves they have made in that massive time span. 
* The whole ""Toronto fits Kawhi's personality"" thing is just pure speculation. I highly doubt this random internet dude has any more of an insight into Kawhi's mind than any of us.
* ""LA has smog"" - We really reaching this far?
* ""What's LA have during the season that keeps him busy?"" - lmao seriously what the fuck? LA is like the most action packed city on planet Earth.

Just read a bit about him on wiki:

> Boucher, a 6'10"", 201 lb forward, was born in Castries, Saint Lucia. He moved with his mother, Mary MacVane, to Montreal when he was five months old to see his Canadian father Jean-Guy Boucher. However, his parents split up when he was young and Boucher had a poor relationship with his father, who deemed him worthless.

WTF, how do you deem a kid worthless? I don't understand this...my parents did that to me at some point and its just messed up. He's a fucking kid!!! (Soz for overreacting, I just felt like I can relate)",04-02-2019,1554215061.0

lets get 1 step ahead of NB and assume that they know theres a lot of controversy around kawhi staying, they are probably also aware that the could get a ton of publicity for their brand new ball line of shoes if their design tempts people into thinking he is staying or going. If I were new balance I would milk the shit out of that because people who know ball are definitely going to be talking about that it in their circles. Thats really good free publicity and NB needs that more than anything trying to establish a new line.

With Harris they're now a really though matchup and Bojan backing up Embiid is kind of a scary task for our centers. I wonder who's supposed to play who? Is Kyle supposed to run after Redick on every plays? If we switch how much is their size gonna expose us? I felt really confident before the trade, but they now have 5 guys that can easily score 20 on any given night.

Milwaukee is also scarier, they have shooters and size and depth and the best player in the league this year and I'm sorry to say this, but until Nurse prove me wrong they have the better coach.",04-03-2019,1554280351.0

Personally I do think you will see him in the playoffs despite what people say cause you can’t run your players to the ground in the early rounds and need a bit of relief to carry on but it will be scrap minutes at that.

&#x200B;

when it comes to the starting lineup, I think the Sixers/Bucks/Raptors have very close talent on paper. The Raps and Bucks work better together so far it seems but you can't deny Philly's talent level. Luckily we have great matchups against them and have guys who can really limit their two most talented guys. The Bucks on the other hand have very good matchups on us so that will be tricky IF we play them. I think even though the Celtics starting lineup is a level below the top 3, they have good matchups against the Bucks. The East playoffs are going to be very, very good this year and it has nothing to do with Lebron being gone. If Lebron was in the East this year he would've been absolutely dicked by the top 4 teams.

Tor'Onto, Summer

*opening shot is a fort surrounded by snow, howling winds and blowing snow swirl in the foreground whilst a single polar bear walks across the background behind the fort. A raven lands on the right hand windowsill and is picked up by someone offscreen*

*The shot pans from a roaring fire in a large fireplace over to the right where Masai Ujiri is reading a scroll, with Bobby Webster seated in front of him. A large rock is being wheeled out of the office in the background*

Webster: ""so what news hath arriveth?""

*Masai reads to the bottom of the scroll and his lips purse into a wry smile*

Ujiri: ""it seems the King of the east is no more.""

*shot reveals the scroll which reads: ""LeBron James has agreed to 4-year, $154M deal with House Lakers, Klutch Sports says. @wojespn""*

Webster: ""And there are rumblings about a superstar in the west looking to escape to a new house.""

Ujiri: ""you mean?"" 

*Webster points to a scroll unfurled on the desk which reads: ""Kawhi Leonard, indeed, wants out of San Antonio, per source. And NBA Summer is officially on fire. @davidaldridgedc""

*Ujiri nods and turns his gaze to the window towards the gates of the fort, where the giant rock (which was in the office earlier) is now being loaded onto a red and blue painted wagon. After it is loaded, another crew member dressed in furs donning the Raptors logo walks up and lazily tosses a Red Auerbach trophy into back of the wagon beside the large rock. As the gates start to open, the crew member walks up to the horse at the front, slaps it on its rear end, and the horse starts running in the direction of the now setting sun*

Ujiri: ""I need you to accompany our best men. We shall rescue him from House Spurs and return with him to the north""

*Webster nods and the screen fades to black. The screen fades back to light, and the exterior of the fort is shown. The gates open and 2 horses exit the fort first. The rider on the left is wearing a full helmet and a fur coat with the number 9 stitched onto it. The rider on the right has a long, wiry beard, wearing a fur coat with the number 17 stitched onto the centre of it. A yak pulling a covered wagon follows the 2 riders. As the screen fades to black, a raven is seen flying out of the window on the right side of the fort*

*the screen returns showing the interior of the wagon where Webster is seated with 3 men in fur coats. The one to the left of Webster turns to face him*

DeRozan: ""What is the plan here, my Lord?""

*the other two men, (one wearing a dinosaur skull as a helmet with the number 7 emblazoned on his fur coat, and the other with the number 43 on his coat) both turn their gaze towards Webster*

Webster: ""We shall wait until nightfall. And under cover of darkness, we will sneak in through the back door of House Spurs. We have someone on the inside who will leave it unlocked.""

*Webster is holding a crudely drawn schematic of  the fort of House Spurs and points to a gate drawn on the right side. Outside the wagon, the sun sets and the moon rises as the caravan pulls up to dark seemingly abandoned fort. 5 of the men tip toe towards a slightly open gate in the moonlight.*

Webster: ""I will ready the wagon and horses for our escape. Continue to the end of the hall of honoured knights, it will lead you to the main chamber of their Lord Commander, then just past that will be the knights' chambers.""

*Webster is shown exiting the covered wagon and he starts unhitching the yak from the front of the wagon. The scene switches to the group of men, (2 of them holding torches) as they pass terrifying large statues in a dark, creepy hall. Siakam looks up at a statue wearing a tunic with the number 44. The statue seems to be holding a ball made of ice. Valanciunas looks up to his right at a statue wearing the number 12. The statue appears to be kicking a fallen knight in the face.*

Webster: ""In the office on the right side of the desk, is a box chained down and locked. The key will be in the 2nd drawer on the right of the desk. Inside the box there will be a bunch of numbered glowing disks. Retrieve the disks with number 2 and 4 on them, and continue onto the knights' chambers.""

*DeRozan and Lowry tip toe past a guard who appears to be asleep. DeRozan makes his way around the large desk towards the box that looks like it is decorated with the anguished, screaming faces of the damned. Lowry throws the key up to DeRozan who goes to put the key in the lock,  hesitates, then finally inserts the key and turns it. The box is opened and emanates an eerie green light and low moaning sound. DeRozan and Lowry quickly turn towards the inactive guard in a panic, but it looks like he remains asleep. They then look back at each other relieved*

Lowry: ""Let's not waste anymore time.""

*DeRozan picks through the box and removes the glowing disks numbered 2 and 4. They move past the office and towards the sleeping knights' chambers*

Webster: ""Enter the chambers marked 2 and 4 and push the correct numbered disk into the side of the corresponding knight. Then make your way back out the same way you came. I shall await your return.""

*DeRozan hands Lowry the small glowing disk labeled with the number 4, and they part ways for a moment. DeRozan makes his way to a dimly lit door with a faded number 2 painted onto it. He carefully and quietly opens the door to find a knight who's skin and eyes are as blue as the ice that surrounds his northern castle leaning against the back wall. DeRozan freezes momentarily and draws his sword.*

*He cautiously walks towards the cornrowed knight, number 2 disk in hand and starts to push the glowing disk into the side of the standing knight. The disk disappears into his side and DeRozan jumps backwards in a defensive stance. The blue skin and eyes of the knight slowly start to regain their original colour and he starts blinking a few times before focusing his gaze on DeRozan*

DeRozan: ""I'm here to rescue you. We must leave at once.""

*The once frozen knight nods and follows DeRozan out of the chamber where Lowry and a mohawked knight wearing the number 4 are waiting. They make their way back through the office and meet up with Valanciunas, Ibaka and Siakam who are standing guard wielding swords and shields.*

Lowry: ""Is everyone here?""

*they all look at each other and nod*

Lowry: ""Okay. Let us make haste!""

*the exhausted group enter the great hall of past knights and start to pass the apparently sleeping guard. They all make it past except DeRozan who accidentally trips and stumbles on the foot of the guard. The guard rises to his feet and lets out a deafening roar.*

DeRozan: ""RUN!""

*DeRozan rises to his feet and starts to run after the group of knights. They all look towards the exit and notice that Bobby Webster is now standing in the exit*

Webster: ""Hurry!"" 

*a half dozen knights with blue skin appear in the hall behind the one guard and start advancing towards the group trying to get to the exit. Another blue faced figure steps into the light beside the original guard at the doorway*

Popovich: ""WEBSTER! THIS WAS NOT THE DEAL""

*a few of the knights run past Webster and towards the wagon. Suddenly two guards wearing the numbers 12 and 22 respectively step out of the shadows of either side of DeRozan and both grab him by the arms.*

Lowry: ""NO!""

*Lowry looks back in horror as DeRozan is being dragged towards Popovich. He stops and turns around to run but is stopped by Webster grabbing his shoulder. He turns his gaze back to Webster confused. Furious. Betrayed.*

Webster: ""You can't keep doing the same thing over and over again.""

*Kawhi is now standing in front of Lowry. Lowry  realizing what is unfolding in front of him, turns towards Kawhi and tries to push him out of the way.*

Webster: ""Forgive me, Kyle.""

*Webster pulls out a blackjack and hits Lowry upside the head, knocking him unconscious. Kawhi picks up Lowry and brings him to the wagon to which the horses are now hitched to.*

Webster: ""Let's get out of here!""

*Danny and Ibaka are pulling Siakam away from the yak that was once hitched to the wagon but is now hitched to a pole holding up a basketball net near the entrance. They force Siakam into the back of the wagon, and the remaining knights pile in as well. Ibaka  runs around to the front of the wagon and climbs to the top to drive it.*

*The wagon pulls away from the castle where the cold, seemingly lifeless knights are now standing in front. Two holding DeRozan (who seems incapacitated) and one holding the reigns for the Yak. In the covered wagon, Lowry (who is now laying on the floor of the wagon) shakes his head as he regains consciousness*

Lowry: ""Serge, stop the wagon!""

*Lowry starts to stand up with tears starting to well in his eyes, but Leonard immediately restrains him.*

Webster: ""I'm sorry Kyle. It's done.""

*everyone looks out the back of the wagon where back at the castle, Popovich walks up to DeRozan and the Yak, and places his hands on them. Both of their skin and eyes turn into the same shade of pale blue as they shoot a lifeless gaze to the wagon which is now almost out of sight.*

The Raptors may have gotten bitch-slapped by Lebron for multiple years, but at least we got multiple series wins during that time. 

You know who hasn't had a recent playoff series win? The Bucks. They haven't won a series since 2000-01 and in the last 30 years have won a grand total of 2 series. But no one brings that up. No one is talking about the Bucks lack of play-off experience. 

And what about the 76ers? They beat the Heat last year and that was their first series win since 2011-12, before the process started. Philly is a basically a whole new organization now, but no one is talking about there lack of play-off experience and success. 

The Celtics are the only team that has a legit claim to play-off experience. But there not even really in the conversation anymore and I think that they are perfect example of the media giving a team way too much credit. ",04-04-2019,1554429778.0

JV has been a minus in a lot of these big games. Wow 27/13 against GSW! -18. 20/14 against Minnesota! -11. We literally don't need his scoring. We have Kawhi and Siakam and the fucking rest of the bunch for that. JV honestly killed ball movement. The only thing he brings is scoring, rebounding and empty stats right now.

At the tryouts in grade 9 I was heckled and even pushed around during drills for being white (though Eastern European born and have nothing to do with North American history, but I’ve gotten some shitty remarks from people on account of my country/nation of background). I’m not gonna lie, it hurt, but I knew I’d make the team and these guys would become my teammates and almost like brothers to me. I knew I’d have to earn their respect, and I did, with my hard work, hustle, good plays and overall team-first mentality.

We played in tournaments in mostly white cities and communities. My teammates got heckled and pushed/elbowed around for being black. What was happening to them hurt me just as much as what they did to me during tryouts, even more. I had a chance to earn respect and have my teammates get to know me, but my teammates had no chances to earn these peoples’ respect or to have them get to know them. I saw it in their faces and man we were just silent after the tournament. It was tough, even to see that happen right here in Canada out of all places.

It is bad for these media houses for LA or New York to continue to be the shit shows they are. So they target other teams' executives and players.

torontoraptors,fuck,"Our biggest struggles have been against good defensive teams.

We've also struggled a little with turnovers, rebounding, and perimeter D.

Rebounding seems to have been sorted out to a significant degree, which I think is great. Need to still work on long rebounds.

Our D is great, especially in the clutch but we seem to have a habit of overhelping a little too often and struggle on the recovery leading to a lot of points conceded to things like opponent rebound > lockout > open 3 while our defense is a bit all over the place.

We had a bit of an issue with ballmovement (when Kawhi was in the lineup at least) and 3 of shooting at the start of the season. Our coaching staff and new team members seemed to have worked this out very well. Amazing movement, hockey assists, and 3 pt shooting. We were almost entirely reliant on our front court plus DG till now. Just need to double down on taking care of the ball cause those turnovers have fucked us into losing games that we had even been playing super well in. (Jeez Gasol has had a big impact than I thought he would, was slow to come around to believe it but the changes are real).

We get rekt by long bois. I think cause we been super reliant on our front court for scoring most of our season, who struggle a bit vs longer players. I think they also naturally counter our pass heavy system a bit. Our much improved ball movement and shooting should make a difference here.. but our increase in turnovers could be even higher with all that length in the passing lanes.

My takeaway, hard team for us (as far as lower seed teams to) but we've improved a ton in all the areas we struggled a lot with. They're good against better teams too it seems, but I think we've been quite good at adapting this season. I'm guessing a 5 game series.",04-11-2019,1554958387.0
