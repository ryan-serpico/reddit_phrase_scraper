lakers,fuck,I do. Recency bias is a pain in the ass. I dont care how the clippers looked against the warriors either. No one apparently has a fucking clue how well lebron and AD are going to mesh together. It's going to be seamless. No two players that I feel complement each other more to be honest. A spot up sniper at the point is all we need. I really hope you dont think anyone on the clippers is going to stop Anthony Davis. Lebron is the best player in the NBA. Harrell is going to get his ass fouled off the court and were going to force so many mismatches in our favor in the lebron AD pick and roll. I'm honestly more excited than concerned because people all forgot that not only lebron and ad are two top five players....but they're also two top five players that are going to make each other BETTER!! Surrounded by lethal shooters and a good rim runner and shot blocker in McGee. Cousins off the bench to start the season?? In a league that had made the switch from super teams to super duos - we clearly have the best super duo and it's not even close. Golden  state got fucked in the finals with depth....but how fucked they got was an anomaly. I'm looking at 10 very solid pieces and 2-4 low risk high reward players on our team.

lakers,damn,"We did well on FA based on the circumstance.

&#x200B;

To play Devil's advocate, I think we will have issues with our defense unfortunately. Rondo, Daniels and Cook all have serious issues with their defense and are not switchable (harder to hide), this made out of more than half of our backcourt minutes. Cousins, Kuzma, Lebron, McGee are inconsistent as well. We do have DG, Davis, AC, and Dudley who are considered a plus defensively. Overally, this is a team that will have issue guarding elite perimeter players due to only having DG who is consistently great perimeter defender and a not switch-friendly roster (Rondo, Daniels, Cook, AC, KCP, McGee, and Cousins all not great on switches). This limits our option to use team defense to mask our weak perimeter defense (teams will use screens to get DG off their best player) and make us vulnerable defensively.

&#x200B;

The Clippers' depth is imo objectively better than ours based on past season performance (Lou, Harrell, Shamet, Beverly all pretty damn good). Kuzma's improvement and Cousins' return to his previous self will determine the ceiling of this Lakers team.",07-06-2019,1562456215.0

Caruso is a SOLID player but not a player I would depend on to contend. He is at or near his ceiling. Im not convinced by players shining when a team is out of contention.

lakers,shit,"I was taken aback a few weeks ago when I saw Magic Johnson on TV talking about why he quit the Lakers. Why make it so public? He was throwing Pelinka under the bus and then all the ass kissers on ESPN defended Magic. They were helping Magic shape the narrative that the unknown former agent Pelinka, (agents are conniving and bad!) had done shady shit to the beloved and honest Magic Johnson.   (Im sure Magic is a fine person, I do think his ‚Äúlikability‚Äù gets him a pass for professional blunders that other public personalities get roasted for) 

Watching a grown man defend himself so vigorously while the opposing party was not heard from at all and kept everything in house made me suspect Magic more than Pelinka.

He basically didn‚Äôt go to work and his co-workers called him out and instead of taking a measured approach, he quit, went on national TV and blamed others, acted like the victim, made the organization he worked for and has deep connections with look dysfunctional.

He then quickly retreated back to ‚Äúwe are a family and we fight‚Äù, why? Its because he is an opportunist that loves the attention. Here was an the opportunity. 

Kawhi‚Äôs camp was smart enough to know that Magic is a jilted Ex and will spill all the gossip on the Lakers,  so they reached out. Instead of being a professional who had just resigned and letting the Lakers handle it, what does Magic do? He says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help recruit Kawhi for Lakers‚Äù because Magic knows well enough this is a big story and anyone involved will be talked about. He tried to recruit Kawhi and failed. Not only did he faile he failed to recognize that he was being used and that Kawhi was using the Lakers as a back up option. 

Magic was great at playing basketball for the Lakers and as an ambassador for the NBA.

He had been incompetent and immature in his most recent roles with the Lakers, one was official as President of Bball and the other unofficial role of ‚Äúfamily or recruit or whatever he wants to now be called‚Äù

The Lakers have enough class to forgive his antics and move on. They have stuck by everyone of their player and even treated people who wanted to leave (Shaq) with respect during and after their careers. I think Pelinka represents the Lakers interests better than Magic.",07-07-2019,1562510213.0

lakers,fuck,"I don‚Äôt have a timeline but I can pretty much break down for you what I think happened based off everything I‚Äôve read all week. 

Considering the news kawhi met with PG the same day he met with us, and he met with us early in the week, Kawhi was probably planning on this from the start. I think he met with us so it would appear in league circles that he had legitimate interest in the lakers, which is why so many people were saying lakers early in the week. 

He had a long meeting with the clippers Tuesday and a long one with the raptors Wednesday. He probably told both teams something along the lines of ‚Äúget PG and you get me too, if not I go to the lakers and make a dynasty‚Äù 

Now, with the threat of a lakers dynasty the year we are supposed to finally get parity back, a lot of executives around the league are going to be willing to do things they normally wouldn‚Äôt do to ensure their team has a chance to win a championship. The clippers took the bait and gave up 5 fucking firsts to get PG in order to get Kawhi and have a chance at winning now. 

Kawhi basically had no interest in going to the lakers, as reports have since come out that as recently as Thursday night he was considering signing with the raptors if the clippers couldn‚Äôt get the PG deal done. 

Other reports came out that two hours before he signed with the clippers he asked the lakers if they would push their AD deal back. My theory on that is that at the end of the day kawhi wants to win championships and he knows he needs stars to do it, so the lakers were an absolute last resort if no other tram could acquire the star that he desired.

lakers,shit,">the 2019 NBA free agency period has exposed some of these so-called ‚ÄúNBA Experts‚Äù as fraudulent prognosticators. We fall for their click-bait traps every year because we are desperate for any grain of information during the moratorium period. 

For what it's worth, I have a background in journalism and currently work in a loosely related field.

First off, there are some interesting things to unpack from the OP. I think the OP over-simplifies some things and probably focuses too much on individual reporters and tries to create rankings/tiers for them but the crucial thing the OP does identify is that there are three distinct actors involved.

1. The Reporter
2. The Big Company the reporter works for (whether it's ESPN or whether it's as a freelancer)
3. The Audience (us)

\---

Here's the media cycle:

The Reporter has a source who unveils a certain piece of information.

Traditionally, the reporter would wait until there is more concrete information.

But with the media landscape today (and for the past 5+ years) the reporter needs to be the ""first"" to break *information* but not necessarily news.

This is encouraged by Big Company because they want to be ""first"" to break the news to get ratings, views, clicks, whatever.

And, of course, Audience is hungry for all of this information, whether it's good or bad, whether it was properly investigated or not. We just want *something*.

So, Reporter -- in spite of all his/her education and training -- is now forced to rely on Anonymous Source.

And Anonymous Source is the worst fucking source.

And it's all because that's what Big Company wants and that's what Audience wants.

\---

But at the end of the day, it's up to Audience to really fight back. And it's a difficult fight.

We want to be In The Know, we want to be First to break the news, we want to get those delicious upvotes and medals on Reddit, we want to be a Twitter celebrity, etc.

We want bragging rights to say that we were right.

And that's what journalists have been relegated to.

Battling their bosses and their audience in this fight to be ""first"" and to be ""right"" and to ultimately be considered a ""prognosticator.""

But unless the Audience is willing to be patient?

This kind of shit will continue.

And the sad thing is that the stupid people will get butt hurt and not see the subtleties of journalism and just blame someone else.

I think in the long-run? I would love to see a greater understanding of the journalism process. And maybe that's something that more journalists need to talk about. Because I think there's a lot of confusion out there.",07-07-2019,1562489707.0

4th quarter winning time lineup. 1. Bron, 2 Green, 3 Dudley, 4 Kuz 5 AD........might have to go KCP instead of Dudley to have him cover guys like Lillard, CP3, Kyrie.

lakers,fuck,"> Unpopular opinion: Our FO did not do a good job. 

You're getting downvoted but you are absolutely right.

What are we really giving our FO credit for?

* Getting LBJ? Nope, it was *LeBron* who chose us, we didn't choose him.
* Getting AD? Nope, AD and Rich Paul forced his way out and the Lakers just threw assets at the Pelicans.
* For signing whoever was left after we waited for Kawhi? I mean, c'mon, everyone could guess that we'd overpay for Danny Green, re-sign KCP (Klutch client), Rondo (recently a Laker, has played with LBJ, has played with AD, we need a point guard), and sign Cousins (a big ""name"").

> anyone on this sub could have had as good of free agency as rob.  I think our team was built quite well given what occurred yesterday, but let‚Äôs not act like it takes a genius to sign the guys we got. 

Precisely.

\---

At the end of the day, we saw Jerry West outplay Rob Pelinka and the Lakers.

Clippers put themselves in a fantastic position because they had so much more flexibility.

* No Kawhi? No big deal. They're just the Clippers. And they'll grind it out with the talent that they have and make smart moves and what not.
* Yes, Kawhi? Great! They have Kawhi and a strong team like the Raptors.
* Yes, Kawhi but only if Superstar XYZ can be had? Welp, the Clippers had the assets and the guts to pull off a deal for Paul George.

What did the Lakers have?

A slim chance at Kawhi.

Little assets to really do anything short of opening up some more cap space.

But the fact that the Lakers desperately waited for Kawhi?

Well, that shows their lack of confidence in their ability to build a team around LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

Think about that for a second... The Lakers have LEBRON JAMES and ANTHONY DAVIS.

That's a pretty fucking good combo, isn't it?

Plus Kyle Kuzma?

If the Lakers were confident? And believed in themselves?

Their move should have been... Fuck off, Kawhi. We already got AD. And LBJ. And money. Let's go get ... DeAngelo Russell. And then *still* be able to sign the guys that we already signed over the last day or two.

But the Lakers showed their hand. That they are weak. That they were thirsty for Kawhi even when they knew that Kawhi saw the Lakers as an option behind the Raptors and Clippers.

\---

Again, to respond to the original post and this comment?

Sure, the FO did OK following the Kawhi announcement. But it's not like they did anything brilliant.

The real task now falls to Frank Vogel, Jason Kidd and the rest of the coaching and training staff to keep everyone healthy, manage loads, and help the likes of Caruso and Kuzma grow and evolve.

lakers,shit,"Nice to see some thought-out analysis in this sea of shitposts. 

All in all, I¬¥m satisfied at how Pelinka bounced back from Kawhi¬¥s betrayal. We can unironically say that we have decent depth. Imo bringing back Rondo and McGee was a no brainer, specially for vet mins. I'm not too keen on KCP, specially on a 2-year deal that high, but he is a solid 3&D guard that we will probably use when LBJ is at point. 
Danny Green is a tad bit overpriced but he is the most welcomed arrival (besides AD obv). I think he's always been a better Kyle Korver guy that actually could D up some elite players in the Playoffs. He should really feed off Bron. Cousins is somewhat of an asterisk but given that he's coming at a such low risk salary, you can't blame Pelinka at all. At his best he's the best center in the league, at his worst he gives you 15-10 a night but as we saw in the Finals, is a liability in transitional defense and is quite slow. Hopefully a healthy summer improves his conditioning. 

In terms of competition, I think that the West as you said is going to be a bloodbath, there are 6-7 teams that are legit contenders and wouldn't surprise me a bit that got to the WCF. Obviously the two LA¬¥s squads are going to be up there, specially in the Playoffs even if they end up a lower seed than expected. I can't help but not count out Golden State (they still have a top-4 player and 2 other All-Stars) and obviously Houston, regardless of that Harden-Paul beef. 

Nuggets, Blazers and Jazz are the ""outsiders"" but still expect them to be on the fight. 

In the East, Milwaukee is the top dog after Kawhi¬¥s departure from the 6. Unpopular opinion but I think Philly is worse than last year, and I don't see Boston or Brooklyn without KD getting to the Finals.",07-07-2019,1562495139.0

AD,
LeBron,
Kawhi (x),
PG (x),
Lou Will (x),
Danny Green,
Cousins,
Harrell (x),
Kuzma,
Beverly (x),
KCP,
McGee, 
Shamet (x),
Harkless (x),
Rondo

Bron and Ad are the better duo than Leonard and PG.

Kuz can explode like Lou Will, but Lou aint 6th man of the year damn near every year for no reason. Kuz HAS TO come back better, offensively and defensively.

Green has the edge on Beverly because he can defend 1-3 and maybe a 4 at times, Beverly will try to and be pesky but that shit aint gone always be consistent.

As far as bench goes, we are missing 1 PIECE, just one and it all depends on if Memphis buys his ass out. Im hoping they do, even then we gotta hope the Clippers don‚Äôt get to him before us.

Clippers will be able to switch everything so they have us beat on the defensive end when it comes to small ball, but we have to make them pay on offense with the big men.

Which takes me to my next point. Can we stop them tho, can we get the necessary stops on them? PG and Leonard WILL get buckets, as for right now we dont have the forwards to truly match up with them. Thats why a Iggy buyout is so important.

The coaching staff of the Lakers are going to probably run a lot of traps on those two, but our pick game HAS to he strong and communication is key.

What people are also missing is. Coaching. Clippers have the better and more seasoned coaching staff. Our guys have to prove it

Right now with the current rosters, i say this goes to 7 if everyone is healthy and is playing at a high level.

lakers,dick,"I don‚Äôt understand this sub‚Äôs obsession with kemba or dLo. Both are ball-dominant PGs that need the ball in their hands to be effective. We saw what happened last year when LBJ was paired with ball handlers. Neither was worth a max to their own teams either.

I‚Äôll admit that butler would‚Äôve been nice, but not for the max imo. He doesn‚Äôt shoot 3s (but he‚Äôs got some great d). 

Reddick is butlers polar opposite. Shoots lights out but doesn‚Äôt play a lick of defense. 

Green was a much better signing than either. Less money than butler and approximately even money to reddick, yet he plays both ends of the floor and his shooting splits are great.

Bullock would‚Äôve been a perfect fit, but you can‚Äôt blame him for wanting to get paid. 

I think Pelinka (and Vogel) have filled out the roster well, all things considered. We have the best PnR duo in the league, we needed shooters to compliment the PnR which we got. The PG position is an obvious weakness but it‚Äôs not a glaring as some are making it out to be, we have LBJ that can run point when we need him to.",07-07-2019,1562526212.0
lakers,fuck,"i think so. how do you stop AD+LBJ pick'n'roll, esp when they're surrounded by shooters like Danny Green and Quin Cook, plus a slasher like Kuzma? 

&#x200B;

PG+Kawhi are an amazing combo, best defensive combo on the perimeter by far, but what are they going to do when Lebron dishes/lobs it to AD? LAC doesn't have any size to contain AD unless Zubac turns into prime Tyson Chandler over the summer. 

&#x200B;

Outside of the obvious domination of LBJ+AD, the key for the Lakers imo to win it all will be:

1. Can Kuzma take a leap in his abilities, both adding a consistent 3pt shot and becoming a somewhat average defender?
2. What will Danny Green look like with a passer like Lebron? Danny has always been a great shoot-n-catch guy, but he's never played with a passer as good as Lebron. If LBJ can elevate Green's perimeter threat, you have a real problem
3. What sort of DMC do we have next season? Can he be 60-70% of pre-achilles DMC? If so, how the fuck do you play again an AD+LBJ+DMC front court with Danny Green and Quin Cook at the perimeter ready to fire off wide open looks?",07-07-2019,1562521748.0

Now LeBron is of course interchangeable anywhere. AD can play PF/C also 

I think our starters should be 
1 rondo
2 green
3 LeBron
4 kuz
5 AD

Boogie should be our 6h man until he gets into the groove then maybe later take over at center and put AD back to the 4 while kuz gets the 6th man role.

 But I'm hesitant about a twin towers situation in this small ball generation so I'd rather not play AD and DMC together so much. 

Everyone else should get minutes only to relieve the fatigue of these 6 guys . Of course if the bench puts up numbers you get them some more minutes to rest Bron and AD for a few games hopefully.",07-07-2019,1562541210.0

#7 Rockets. People say they have chemistry issues but all those reports were said to be wrong from players inside the rockets team, and without that slow start last year w. melo, they wouldve been even higher on the standings. And cp3 might get injured.

#8 spurs. With okc out of the picture, this team is solid and should have an easier time getting into the play offs.

#9 Pelicans. I believe they have a shot at the play offs. But if lonzo keeps up that 45% ft shooting good luck. If BI becomes the primary ball handler and plays like he did post all stat break, and elevates his passing to use shooters like reddick, this team can take #8

#10 Mavs. This team improved from last year and may make the play offs but assuming they dont they land # 10

Jus my opinion.

lakers,hell,"Nah homie. 

#1 Los Angeles Lakers (we were #4 last year b4 injuries, with the worst ft shooting in the league, no shooting, and playing with unproven young players) this team is a monstrous leap

#2 Denver Nuggets (theyre fuckin dope)

#3 Blazers. Very good squad. Made it to the WCF without 1 of their best players. 

# 4 La Clippers (this team, while very very good, lacks passing ability in their 2 superstars who will have the ball in their hands a majority of the time. And Kawhi will miss many games due to load management.) 

#5 Jazz (very strong team)

#6 Warriors. Warriors may have lost KD but they will begin the season with Curry, Dangelo, and Draymond. Thats still very scary. And once klay comes back, i imagine he will be game 6 klay in every game cause hell understand the importance of home court advantage in the play offs.

lakers,shit,"An interesting take on Ball's lack of shooting ability.

I was watching one of the sports networks and some dude was on telling a story about him and a fellow NBA player were at a gym playing hoops. Unfortunately, I can't remember who the other NBA player was that they saw. Maybe Kemba?   

But anyway. They said there were two NBA players in the games - the one dude and Lonzo Ball.  They said the other dude was playing like it was an NBA game. He was taking shots and drives just like the shots and drives he would take in the NBA (hence - working on his NBA game).

They said that Lonzo was doing crazy shots, double-pump spins, etc.....IE: shots that he will never take in a real NBA game.

The moral of the story. One guy was working on his game. Lonzo, whose only weakness is shooting (and staying healthy) didn't spend the time practicing his shots or trying to improve his NBA situation type shots....but instead, was doing all kinds of crazy shit.

That's something to think about when people wonder if Lonzo is ever going to improve his shooting.

(And yes, I know, this is Reddit. So some people will say ""Maybe he just practicing shooting for 12-hours straight and was just letting off steam"" or ""what the fuck do these idiots know, they don't know what Lonzo does in his private time).   I'm just sharing a story I saw on one of the sports  networks.   I give it weight, remember a few years back when people said that the weakest part of LEbron's game was his outside shooting.

lakers,fuck,"Come on. The signing last year indicated an experiment at best. We hired dawgs with ball handling skills and poor outside scoring. This roster is so much better compared to last year's. Obviously I'll miss your young guns. But Ingram and Ball were misfits next to lebron. They will have a much better time in New Orleans.

Im pumped. I do see us among the top five teams. It will be tough and we have to hope nobody gets injured. When the news about the signings came out last year, I was always like: 'the fuck. Why?!'. This year every signing makes  a lot of sense. The risk we take is much lower as we bet on a proven concept, LeBron + shooters. Plus, we've got pretty good big guys not to mention AD. This team has the potential to be the best, most balanced team LeBron has ever played on. What can fuck us up are injuries only, imho.

Last year was a disaster in many ways (three point shooting, free throws, and injuries of course). This year we are much more balanced. If Demarcus cousins gets much better, and we are lucky when it comes to staying healthy, we'll win it all. As we'd be a mismatch for most teams due to the bigs we've got on our roster.

He was on the court when Klay went down with an ACL tear.

Kawhi Lebron and Ad are amazing and would no doubt win a chip. But at what cost?

3 players having the responsibility of carrying a team, is very effective but its also risky cause if any of them goes down, you have a big gap in your team.

 I can understand why he left.

How ever i do think he chose the wrong franchise.. The clippers??? 

They are basically the secondary team and hell never be a household name even if he wins chips there it will be forgotten cause that franchise is trash

Nuggets retained pretty much all of a very talented young core (even is Murray is a fucking tool) and I don't see Jokic getting any worse...which is terrifying. 

For all the talk of the Clippers being deep I actually think the Jazz are the deepest team in the conference. 

The Clippers are gonna get hyped to high heaven before the season begins and they sort of deserve to. Only thing that makes me think is what if last season was an outlier? What if either of Beverley or Williams takes a step back. Lou has been in the league 15 years next season. Will Kawhis body hold together? I think there are a lot more questions about that squad than people seem to want to realize. 

Being 4th best in this conference isn't really a slight. It has been a long, long time since the West has been this deep. Whilst obviously I root for us I really think the Jazz are getting slept on.

In the US people are saying a lot of crap, but Lakers are arguably as good as Clippers, if not better. #2 and #13 play in the same position, and although that wouldn't be a huge concern, one of them is going to have to play a position they're not most comfortable with. People in the media are talking about Lebron like he's injury prone now, and saying he's 35 (he will be in December I think), when last season he carried a huge load on his shoulders and still averaged 27/8/8. Now he has AD and a bunch of players that can actually use his passing abilities best. #2 and #13 are great, but Lebron and AD are better, just look at career stats. AD is in his prime and Lebron is slightly below his prime, but pretty much still up there. Lakers, mentally speaking, are all locked in championship mode now.

Defensively the Clippers are going to be great. Kawhi Beverley and George are some of the best defenders in the league. 


The NBA is a stars league and I think Bron+ AD is better than Kawhi+George, simply because Kawhi and George are both similar in what they bring to a team whereas LeBron and AD both bring much different skillsets to the Lakers.

But AD's value is much much higher than everything we gave up including the future picks as long as he stays healthy and the team builds around his strengths for the future which I am sure Pelinka is capable of doing.

That means whoever starts at SF will need to guard 1 of the opposing guards (with Danny green guarding the other)

Keep in mind that when RDA said Kawhi was coming, Butler, KD, and Kemba were off the board in free agency and there was nobody left for Kawhi to team up with. It‚Äôs very possible Kawhi was resigned to coming to the Lakers and indicated he was likely coming and just needed to take other meetings as a courtesy, and then changed course once he thought he could convince PG to request a trade. I guarantee very few people thought the Clippers would be able to trade for Paul George. Just because an extreme long shot scenario happened, doesn‚Äôt mean RDA was full of shit.

lakers,fuck,"Here‚Äôs what drives me nuts with NBA free agency compared to MLB or NFL: NBA fans don‚Äôt seem to understand that the players typically choose which teams they want to play for, not the other way around. 

Just because your favorite team has cap space doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to get whoever they want within that budget. These players are people who are making decisions that effect their families, friends, and their future. Who says Brogdon would‚Äôve come? Who says Seth Curry would‚Äôve come? Or D‚ÄôLo? Just because we have the cap space doesn‚Äôt mean we make that decision for them. 

There are instances in which a team can screw up their free agency by overpaying (see Deng and Mozgov) but putting the blame on the franchise for something that is out of their control is dumb af. NBA fans need to drop this mentality.

When RDA posted that there was no second star left in free agency, and its plausible the Thunder could‚Äôve just said no to the trade and the Clippers wouldn‚Äôt have had a shot.

lakers,hell,"Lebron is Lebron but Miami Lebron is something else. Hell Cavs Lebron from two years ago was legendary too. 

Anthony Davis is arguably or could be his best teammate since he‚Äôs young and still not in his prime.

Kyrie imo is overrated as hell. 

Lakers don‚Äôt have a clear third fiddle. Kuzma? Boogie? So the other team have them beat on that for now. Aka Bosh/Love. 

Depth and rest of the roster? I can say that it‚Äôs a bit behind the Heat/Cavs teams. Again. It depends since we haven‚Äôt seen them play yet. Stand out players we have? Danny Green. Lebron always had that role player that saves the day with a hot hand. JR, Ray, Shard, etc. shooters. In theory Lakers loaded up this year and hopefully they don‚Äôt magically forget to shoot like last year‚Äôs team.

#2 He has ‚Äúled‚Äù one team one time. 

#3 He has had only one great play off run. 

#4 His playmaking is not elite and it showed in the finals when he played like a role player the whole series because Draymond was doubling him at half court. 

#5 KD would‚Äôve slapped that ass if he played. 

#6 If I hear one more comment about AD or Lebron being fragile ima lose my dick because the man literally has a degenerative issue in his leg and the reason he took a shorter contract is though he is able to lock down one last 4 year before his legs officially give out.

And ESPN was showing a bunch of the highlights of her and the team. Holy cow, what an obnoxious team. Rapinoe constantly doing the Gladiator pose, everybody acting all gangsta, etc.

When they first got bashed for celebrating too much, I was on their side, and my view was ""come on, let them have some fun."" But after watching the constant posing and choreographed celebration and victory moves, they really just come off as being extremely arrogant and obnoxious.

No easy buckets, no movement. Magic was like that times a thousand. He was the engine that made it go.

I shit on your bench. I laughed at the idea that Cousin's has any impact on your championship hopes. Those of you who cheered for the likes of Daniels, McGee, Dudley as being meaningful additions, you guys are kidding yourselves.

But Chris Paul would change things. He is not anywhere near as good as Kawhi Leonard anymore, but people are kidding themselves if they think he is washed up. 

And he's perfect. He can be a primary ballhandler during most of the game, letting James conserve himself, he can defend opposing point guards, he's a spot up shooter, he gives your two superstars one of whom is old and the other is, frankly, injury prone, a third someone who can carry a lineup on their own.

While those players individually don‚Äôt scare me, it‚Äôs some good bench pieces to have. Not really high on Trez though at all. And we have to see how the injuries work out for them. Let‚Äôs not forget that PG had surgery on both shoulders. 

Imo the Grant pickup for Denver was huge. He‚Äôs so underrated as a role player off the bench or as a starting 3. They also have MPJ, who if he can stay on the court, could be pretty good even in his rookie year. Denver is just stacked 1-9 and if both Murray and Jokic takes a step, they are so dangerous.

Rockets I gotta see how it works out and while D‚ÄôAntoni is a great coach, he seems to trust only 4 guys on his team come April.


Blazers got that continuity that is really intangible in the playoffs and Baze was a great pickup. Hassan I‚Äôm not that crazy about. He reminds of Dwight too much.

We can‚Äôt even match how much CP3 makes without using Green and I‚Äôd rather have Green at this point in time.

Also. A number of players on the Lakers have no trade clauses.

Kawhi- had the best in terms of load management last season, was hobbled by the finals. He was blessed with GSW's 2 stars going down with major injuries, and the underrated performances by Gasol, Lowry, and Vanvleet. The dude has degenerative knee issues and is on a team that will be leaning on him in what I believe is still a much tougher western conference.

Look up what Nike makes per year and what the NBA makes per year.

Nike makes so much goddamn money that they are not going to be concerned with production and changing numbers.

If LBJ gets traded, it would cost Nike very little to turn around and produce new jerseys. And the new jerseys they sell will cover the loss from the other jerseys.

Remember, these companies produce Championship merchandise for BOTH sides.

That means there are 2019 Warriors NBA Finals Champions t-shirts and memorabilia currently being donated to third-world countries.

Lonzo is very small percentage of Nike profits. In fact, he's probably a loss.

They don't give a fuck about Lonzo and where he goes. Nor do they care about influencing NBA clubs on player transactions.

The *macro*, the big picture?

Who is trying to discredit Kobe?

Some kids on Twitter or Reddit?

The reality is that Kobe and Shaq both needed each other to win championships. But since both were young and headstrong they thought that they were more important than the other and that eliminated their chance to win even more championships.

You see it now with the interviews that Shaq does nowadays. He could've done more with Penny. And he could've done more with Kobe.

lakers,damn,"Pros: Elite guard defense, can pick up full court and good off ball defense. Always makes the right adjustment in a fast break scramble or pick and roll. 

elite vision, which leads to above average passing and rebounding for a guard. 

Good size and athleticism, has very good top speed. 

Very high basketball iq usually found only in vets

Tenacious and doesn‚Äôt give up even when losing badly. 

Cons: Can‚Äôt shoot consistently at all. Free throws are atrocious 

Soft when finishing. Seems almost afraid of contact at times and shys away from the posters or dunks in traffic.

Handles need to be tightened up and often lead to turnovers.

Injury prone.






So over all he‚Äôs on path to be an A tier role player. Add him to any championship team with a ball dominant guard that can shoot and he‚Äôs going to raise the teams floor. If he gets healthy and becomes even a serviceable shooter he‚Äôs going to be a force for the next decade and a half.  So to get that out of a number two pick is not a bad thing at all.

lakers,shit,"I mean, i hate plaschke just as much as the next fan, but at the time, I remember being distraught losing Shaq. 

Kobe and Shaq was the greatest duo and my entire childhood revolved around watching these two play. And together, they were incredibly dominant on the court, so to have him traded at the time just seemed so unreal. Had they worked out their differences, and both of them stayed on the Lakers, they could have won more championships together, and thats the truth. Ego, work ethic and commitment were the issues. 

Shaq did win a ring in Miami, and at the time, I hated the fact that Shaq won a championship with Dwade instead of Kobe. Like, it *pissed* me off. And Kobe was struggling with the shit roster on a confused team, and practically wasting away his prime, and overlooked by the league when Kobe clearly deserved to be the MVP more than once. 

Was it a mistake? In hindsight, no, because Kobe won 2 more with Pau.

lakers,asshole,"For those too young/weren't around, Shaq was an asshole about it while Kobe took the high road. Shaq was already on the decline and wanted Doc Buss to extend his contract - which was grandfathered in the old CBA. This meant Shaq in his late 30's would've been making $40 million/season.

It was clear neither wanted to play with one another and we had to make a choice. To me and any sensible fan, it was a no brainer who you choose. One guy was 32, had an arthritic toe, and lazy. The other was just 26, already the best in the game, and laser focused on being the GOAT. Yet half the fan base actually wanted the team to keep Shaq over Kobe, and they jumped ship to root for Miami. Plaschke was one of them. We started hearing the stupid narrative that Kobe was like Pippen and would never lead a team to a championship.

If you go back to Plaschke's articles starting in 2003, you can see he relentlessly trashed Kobe. Then in 07-08 when Bynum had his breakout and we got Pau Gasol, he and all the other backstabbers came running back.

Should he start? Yes, but not yet. I expect KCP-Green pairing with LeBron being the PG at half-court set.

Vogel is an X and O coach. If he starts or not is dependent on if Caruso can pick up the play book and know what to run and how to read the game. I believe this is why Rondo is back as well. Rondo's strength is at his game IQ. He remember plays well. 

His defense? Eye test, better than Rondo, but no better than Green or KCP.

How would he fit with LeBron over Bradley / KCP? Nothing special. He doesn't do stupid shit. He remember plays better than KCP.

lakers,bitch,"> I hope this team doesn't turn out like the 2018 Cavaliers, (alot of talent but too many egos)

That Cavaliers team really didn't have any talent aside LeBron when you go over their roster. 

Kyrie was gone, Love hadn't been a star for a while, Wade and Korver were on their last legs, JR and Tristan Thompson fell off a cliff, Larry and Jordan are 6th man material at best, Green and Hood are best known for being inconsistent, Crowder laid so many bricks they shipped his ass out. Hill was probably their 3rd best player and he wasn't as good as this year, what they really needed at the position was playmaking.

Our team is just so much better. We have 2 top 7 players for starters, and when you compare who comes after the 2 best players on each team we're just so much more loaded.

As far as egos being an issue, I think the only players to be concerned about are McGee, Rondo and Kuz. 

JaVale bitched about Zu but with AD not wanting to play the 5 he should get playing time, so hopefully we won't have a repeat of that. Rondo I'm concerned he'll get a much bigger role than needed because of his experience, and at this point I'd never play him unless LeBron is out. Still, he has chemistry with AD and Boogie. Kuz will have to adjust because with so much firepower he might see his minutes and looks shrink a bit. 

Everyone else knows their role. LeBron and AD come first but they are the unselfish type of superstars. Boogie has shown he can play with a bunch of stars. Guys like Green, KCP and Beverley know they have to play hard on D and make the open shot. Daniels, Caruso (even if he deserves more) and THT will look for opportunities in a long season. 

Being a completely new team it's not going to be easy, but we've put together a great coaching staff and we have great leadership so I'm confident we can get things done.",07-15-2019,1563172053.0

LO was indeed addicted to drugs and that's something that is incredibly difficult to overcome and I'm not trying to downplay the difficulty and the severity of it. But there are people in worst circumstances, who don't have access to that many resources and support structure to help them kick the drug but they manage to anyway.

Granted perhaps having that much money means access to those drugs is that much easier but again he needed to seek help for himself regardless. He needed to tell his closest people that hey I need help.

Then he went to the lakers and i saw each lakers game. Even when he was out.

For the first time i became a big fan of other players.

Especially Brandon Ingram.

Then i came on this subreddit and I realized something..

Lakers fans are basically the Yankees fans of the NBA..

And ive always been a yankees fan.

Best franchise.

With another team in the city that will always be the little bitch.

Can have some losing seasons but will always bounce back.

People hate the team for absolutely no reason.

As I got older, other than liking D-Wade I fell away from hoops because my house was a football house and only got back into it a few years back. As Wade slowed down, LeBron‚Äôs gravitational pull called to me considering how close they were on the floor and off.

It was up until I saw my dad and his friend go and watch a Spurs vs Lakers playoff series and I think it's the one with the Derek Fisher buzzer beater long story short I saw my dad cheer for LAL and that was it, then I saw Kobe dominate and I used to run him in NBA2K8 and forward it was so much fun playing Kobe there he was like a cheat code, ever since then I do my best to root for the LA LAKERS and when they're not in the playoffs I just root for the underdog,

Except Boston, Fuck Boston and I used to actually like the clippers since I felt bad for a whole city shitting on them for existing hahaha I hope they move buildings soon so they can at least claim their own kind fo ""house"" if that makes sense.

That poor shooting performance coupled with the fact that he was benched for long stretches during their championship run contributed to my skepticism, so it's not like Windy is totally off-base here.

lakers,fuck,"PG: LeBron 
SG: Green
SF: Kuzma
PF: Davis
C: Cousins

I legit think that when the Lakers said that LeBron was going to start at Point Guard, they meant Point Guard, not Point Forward like everyone seems to think. There‚Äôs just no reason not to put the best 5 on the court to start. 

I don‚Äôt get the matchup/defense argument everyone has with that lineup too. The length is tops in the NBA, everyone is quick for their size, and the the paint would be impenetrable. And if you‚Äôre worried about the perimeter D, remember that they have crazy length and quick feet to bother any shot, and good luck screening any one of those 5. Just look at Philly, they‚Äôre already doing this exact strategy and they‚Äôre literally a huge problem on D.

And I‚Äôll leave y‚Äôall with this:
Everyone is saying ‚Äúwell who is gonna chase Curry and Dame around the perimeter?‚Äù To that I say, what point guard is supposed to check LeBron fucking James?! And suppose they switch say Kawhi onto James, you‚Äôve got the best passer in the game ready to make the perfect pass to 4 lethal scorers, while occupying the other team‚Äôs best defender. I don‚Äôt want to hear how are we suppose to guard ‚Äúinsert team.‚Äù The real question is, how is any team supposed to guard our best lineup?! There‚Äôs not a single team that can.",07-16-2019,1563254886.0

The Lowe Post: probably one of the better nba pods out there. Zach Lowe does something very few other pods do by talking about smaller market teams from time to time. As a fan of the league, it‚Äôs great for me to hear opinions about the Mavericks or the jazz because I don‚Äôt keep up with them the way I do our team. He brings on mostly nba writers, so they offer a keen level of insight into varying teams. Definitely worth a subscribe. 

The Bill Simmons Podcast: another OG podcast. Bill doesn‚Äôt always cover basketball, but it‚Äôs definitely been a big part of his feed the last couple months. He‚Äôs an extreme homer, will find ways to shit on Kobe and us, and will talk up the Celtics, but you get used to laughing at it after some time.  Still, his podcasts are some of the better nba podcasts out there, and he does cover emerging topics as they happen. Just be ready to avoid getting angry at some of his flip flops. 

The Ringer NBA show: part of the Ringer podcast network, the Ringer nba show has 5 shows a week, all of which are hosted by a different set of hosts. They do emergency pods whenever news breaks, so that‚Äôs pretty cool. My favorite are the Tuesday pods with Kevin O‚ÄôConnor and Chris Vernon, but other people like the Monday show as well. The group chat episode, which airs on thursdays I believe, is the weakest show of the bunch, but the rest are good. They do an episode on Friday that goes over prospects heading into the next draft, so it keeps you a bit more prepared for the coming draft as well. 

The Free Agents: used to be the starters until they got let go by TNT. The starters have covered basketball for a long time, and they have a lot of knowledge about the game. Their podcasts sound a lot like a group of friends talking about basketball, which is pretty appealing to me. They watch chunks of pretty much every game that occurs throughout the season, so they really do bring a lot of knowledge to their shows. They are currently in the process of finding a new station, but that‚Äôs still in the works. 

For the Lakers:

Lakers film room: you‚Äôve already been told lol

Lakers legacy podcast: a group of laker homers talking about being laker fans. Their show has really grown from where it started. They bring on guests to go into the draft, they cover trades, they sometimes bring on Pete from LFR, and they‚Äôre pretty funny. It‚Äôs not the greatest show by any means, but it‚Äôs solid for sure 

Non-NBA related (but I‚Äôm suggesting because they‚Äôre so damn good): 

Against the rules: a podcast by NYT best-selling author Michael Lewis (wrote Moneyball and the Big Short). He looks at how we in America hate the one person we should be loving: the refs. Each episode goes into a different referee in a different field, and how each of these referees acts under differing circumstances. The first episode is about the NBA, and how nba stars are getting into increasingly more vocal conflicts with refs. Steve Kerr is a guest on the first one. It‚Äôs a mini series, so there‚Äôs only like 10 episodes, but it‚Äôs worth a listen. 

Revisionist History: another pod by a best-selling author, this time it‚Äôs Michael gladwell. He looks at parts of history that we misunderstand because the actual story behind those events differs from what we have come to know about that event. For example, he analyzes a song by Elvis Presley and how he struggled to sing a particular line in a song. He then talks to psychologists who go into detail about why that change occurred. We get unaired audio of Elvis recording that song, and how he struggled with this one line over and over, getting it right only when there‚Äôs no one in the room. There‚Äôs another episode about a famous statute in Alabama of a black boy being attacked by a police officer‚Äôs dog. We learn that the boy, who was black, wasn‚Äôt actually a civil rights fan. He wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be there. We also learn that the cop was trying to hold the dog back, not letting it loose. The statue has us believe otherwise. Some of the episodes, like the one about country music, can be pretty shitty. But for the most part, it‚Äôs one of the best shows out there.",07-18-2019,1563467747.0

Million dollar investment!

He's as key to our success coming off the Achilles (which he seemed to have overcome when he hurt the quad) injury as Karl Malone was when we picked him up the season we lost to Detroit!

Demarcus stays healthy we're in serious SERIOUS bidness!

Even if he plays banged up in this load management era we're suddenly in, we're sitting damn pretty this coming season!

Dude is an absolute monster when healthy!

Pretty exciting stuff Lakers fans!

All these transplant Los Angelinos jumping on the Clippers train from the pain of watching their native city team get roasted time and time again are in for a rude awakening once again when the team they grew up hating once again crushes their hopes and dreams!

&#x200B;

When I watch those games again , I see it completely different. One'd have to be really dumb, naive or plain stubborn ( this is what it actually is mostly) to see how bad of a team the Bulls were and how exaggerated the jordan rules really were.

MJ usally made the right basketball play and found the open man (not unlike LBJ) and that player missed it more often than not. It wasn't the exaggerated Jordan rules myth.  It's kind of similar to Cavs vs GSW I vs CAVS vs Spurs I. As soon as they could, the legendary jordan rules were obsolete almost right away. would you really just wait  in the paint for jordan when they're making you pay from afar. 

 If the Bulls had average shooting of the current NBA and the others hit their shots, he'd have easily beaten those guys. They could not and MJ had to exert try to be a one many army and that doesn't work. eventually , you will get tired. 

People bled just as easily back then but how often did players end up with one eye like Harden or Lebron did last few years. those instances are few and far between.  

we like to think thy were were mean mofos but always hit mj in such a way as no make sure he doesn't bleed or not hit his eyes lol.  most probably you were 10 at the time....dude's can't remember what they had for lunch last week  but remember every single play . gtfoh lol

&#x200B;

Look at how van fleet got busted open with such an inadvertent elbow. Klay got hurt with a soft bump. ACL MCL  and facial skin weren't better in the 80s and 90s lol. 

Players swung at others often but how many videos do we have of an actual shot landing and knocking out a guy. it kind of reminds me of how we used to wait for our parents to show up and then start swinging at our siblings. It doesn't take a lot to knock your teeth out. look at hockey players. there's a reason they dont have teeth (sometimes it's stick though) 

&#x200B;

we're so dumb that the NBA actually got us believing having the shits and /or the flu like playing cancer.  

&#x200B;

Reggie and the pacers took the Bulls to 7 games. you really think if you replace  Reggie with a  current positionless  great like Lebron or KD and they dont take out the bulls. c'mon now....

What a dumb fucking take. LA is made up of all sorts of people. The majority, across all spectrums, root for the Lakers. That includes the blue collar worker, the white collar professional, and the Hollywood star.

Whether it‚Äôs a homeless person on Skid Row, a gang banger in Boyle heights, a maintenance/factory worker in Covina/Industry, a warehouse worker in Vernon/Downtown, a construction worker in the OC, a street vendor on the some corner Crenshaw or Washington or Whittier or Cesar Chavez, a lawyer in Culver City, an artist in Santa Monica/The Southbay, or a truck driver in Long Beach, or some professor in USC/UCLA or any of the other Universities and Community colleges, it doesn‚Äôt matter wether you‚Äôre rich or poor, you more than likely root for the Lakers.

Beyond that, most of the stars that have come here are from out of town. Sure, most were drafted in LA, but there aren‚Äôt really any ‚Äúhomegrown‚Äù talents in the Laker stardom.

If anything, the Lakers are far more hometown than the Clippers. Balmer is the epitome of acquired wealth in anything but the hometown, whereas the Busses built the Lakers up over the decades. To the point where people talk shit about the franchise for being a ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù establishment.

Anthony Davis, though he likely stays in LA for at least another contract, owes the Lakers jack shit once he becomes a free agent. Let the season do the talking and let him decide what he wants.

Rich Paul 101: Keep applying pressure. No reason for AD to relax and relinquish any control or play any hand too early. Lebron has the luxury of deciding on a 4 yr deal at 33.

You‚Äôre gonna get booed, no. 2. Deal with it.",07-23-2019,1563894350.0
lakers,fuck,"The code of silence was an unspoken rule.

But Leonard and his representatives made it clear: We have a way we handle business, and we expect the same. Leonard and his camp asked questions and received responses. Details shared in meetings, private and personal information on both sides, were to remain within the group. Leonard promised that to each team and expected the same, sources told Charania.

From their multiple conversations throughout the process, it was clear to the Clippers that trust, privacy and respect were important components of a productive partnership for Leonard.

‚ÄúIf you fuck this up, you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôre out,‚Äù one front-office executive involved in the process explained to The Athletic. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt say that, but that was the message. It was basically, ‚ÄòLook, we would appreciate discretion.‚Äô Which means, ‚ÄòKeep your fucking mouth shut.‚Äô‚Äù

For the Clippers‚Äô purposes, this was not a problem ‚Äî secrecy was their preferred style long before this well-known request had been made.

Remember: The Clippers blindsided the league by trading away Blake Griffin in 2018 and Tobias Harris in 2019. There were no leaks ahead of either deal. The Clippers‚Äô front office operates in the shadows, similar to the way Leonard and his camp have conducted his business since he entered the league in 2011.

The Lakers, whom many around the league presumed were in the lead for Leonard‚Äôs services before he chose the Clippers, famously function on the opposite end of the spectrum, at least in an informal way.

Magic Johnson, the Lakers legend who abruptly resigned as president of basketball operations in late May and proceeded to torch owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka on national television weeks later, thought it wise to broadcast that Robertson had called to pick his brain about the purple-and-gold before free agency had even begun.

‚ÄúI truly believe that when Magic started telling the media about the meeting he had with Kawhi and Dennis, that sealed the fate of the Lakers,‚Äù a person involved in the process told The Athletic. ‚ÄúI think that right there was when Dennis and Kawhi decided we can‚Äôt trust the Lakers as an organization. And that was it. I think that was it for them.‚Äù

Though that act alone didn‚Äôt eliminate the Lakers ‚Äî Leonard still met and communicated with them before his decision ‚Äî Johnson‚Äôs leakage certainly didn‚Äôt help his former employer‚Äôs pitch.

On a fundamental level, the idea of forming a Big Three with James and Davis didn‚Äôt appeal to Leonard‚Äôs core sensibilities. He forged his legacy taking down super teams ‚Äî like the 2014 Miami Heat and the 2019 Golden State Warriors ‚Äî rather than joining them.

‚ÄúElite players like Kawhi earn their stripes, and he was not going to be a guy who joins a so-called ‚Äòsuper team,‚Äô‚Äù one source close to the situation told Charania. ‚ÄúNow, if a super team forms around him, there is nothing he can control. The Clippers were the best long-term fit.‚Äù

As the NBA rumor mill rampantly churned, with multiple league insiders and media personalities placing the Clippers a distant third in the Leonard sweepstakes, the Clippers never felt compelled to respond or alter the public narrative.

Instead, they doubled down on their silence, ghosting the media and going off the grid. They were fine sitting back and obeying Leonard‚Äôs wishes, letting the media speculate and provide information from his meetings with the Lakers and the Raptors.

Honoring Leonard‚Äôs request was the easy part. Finding him a co-star proved more complex.",07-23-2019,1563884621.0

Yes he tried meshing with the young core. No it didn't work. No BI didn't have the astronomical year everyone thought he would. No Zo didn't have an astronomical year everyone thought he would. But when you have a player like AD and you have the assets, then you do it. No one here is pissed that we let go what we let go for AD, especially after you see what Clippers did to get Kawhi and PG together.

And about Kawhi: dude essentially did a KD. He joined a winning team but because he essentially put the team on his back, the hate ain't there. KD walked into a machine that could win championships, Kawhi just ended up being the X-Factor. Yes I'm salty he did what he did and how he did it. And his stupid ass paired up with PG who is a POS in my opinion. I hope they get booed all the time at Staples.

But I'm not worried about them. I remember PG being red hot for a month or two and ultimately disappearing. I know Kawhi being an X Factor is one thing, but being the person carrying the whole load is going to get old fast.

But out of all people, Magic fucking Johnson casually steps down during an unplanned conference without telling his boss, whom he ""loves like a sister"", and then later gives an interview where he torches the entiriety of his supposedly ""beloved"" org for everyone to see, conveniently ignoring reports that Rob was ""backstabbing"" him by being annoyed at Magic not actually working.

And then Khwame Leotard, in times where most players sign or inform about their intentions asap, as sort of ""gentlemen's agreement"", so that all teams interested or involved would not just stay suspended but could fight for other FA's, decides to go full turtle, not letting Toronto, Clips or Lakers do anything. And if reports of him not interested on joining a superteam are true, then only reason for him to even talk to Lakers was to bamboozle them on purpose.

So while I agree that this sub is dragging out these stories too much, it's understandable because these are not your average stories.

4.	Do you think there‚Äôs a competitive team in the league that doesn‚Äôt have to appease their franchise player?
5.	40% of the league became free agents. There was a plan to get a big fish, but inexperienced RP didn‚Äôt even proactively schedule time to meet with Jimmy Butler until it was too late. The roster was put together on the fly because RP got played by Kawhi and had to fill roster spots late. Fair or not, that‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault but his.

OKC and to a lesser extent New Orleans made off like bandits and got instant soft rebuilds with future picks all with one phone call. If AD were to leave for LA next year then New Orleans would be right back to square one trying to scramble to put anything around Zion and Jrue. The OKC/PG situation is a bit different as he was goin into year 2/5, but what if PG had signed a 1+1 instead of an extension and left OKC  and Russ capped out with no future?

lakers,hell,"From the article on their site. 

Las Vegas has proven to be a talent hub for current and former pros to come play in Ultimate Hoops, ranging from former NBA players like Jerome JYD Williams, to current professionals playing overseas like Jeremiah Massey and David Bell.


Will Cousins wear an official league jersey next week?

It‚Äôs not every day, however, that a current NBA player walks into the gym and wants to get a game in.

That‚Äôs exactly what happened last night in Summerlin, as DeMarcus Cousins was hanging out in the gym and got recruited by Chris Mitchell to play for Livin‚Äô the Dream.

Players are eligible to join a UH league up to Week 5, so the addition of Cousins was legal (what wasn‚Äôt legal was Cousins wearing a t-shirt and not an official UH jersey, or a jersey that matches the rest of your team, which results in an automatic technical). He got to run alongside Massey, Mitchell and the rest of Livin‚Äô the Dream against BTE, a team that has won three of the last four Summerlin Open titles.

Cousins didn‚Äôt disappoint in his UH debut, scoring 43 points and grabbing 13 rebounds. It was clear that he was (understandably) trying to avoid the paint and taking contact, as 23 of his 31 shots were from deep (he made 10 of them).

Despite Livin‚Äô the Dream having three current professionals on the floor, with one them being an NBA All-Star, the team chemistry of BTE still prevailed, as they moved to 3-0 on the season with a 119-105 win.

While many teams across UH Nation would probably be upset to see an NBA veteran get added to their opponent‚Äôs roster right before tipoff, BTE embraced it.

‚ÄúBTE has only lost once in the last year. They were excited to play against a player of Cousins‚Äô stature and fame,‚Äù Summerlin League Coordinator, L.C. Comine, said.

Comine added that Cousins told Mitchell, ‚Äúthis may not be a one-time thing.‚Äù",07-25-2019,1564030249.0

Doc is even worse than Lue....he had lob city and pissed it away. He also gave his dogshit son a laughably bad huge contract that couldve been spent on much better help for the lob city crew.

lakers,shit,">It is a movement fueled by local fans, particularly younger ones and newer ones, who have grown weary of the drama-filled Lakers.

So the narrative now is that drama turns off NBA fans and especially young fans? Lol okay. Interesting spin.

>‚ÄúThese new-age players coming up now in street ball, they like being PG and Kawhi, those are players they can relate to because they‚Äôre both from L.A.,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe older generation, age 40 and up, they know about Showtime and the Lakers, but for this new generation, the YouTubers, the millennials, it‚Äôs all about the Clippers right now.‚Äù

So they're so young that they missed the Shaq-Kobe 3peat team and the Kobe-Gasol back-to-back championship team (9 years ago), and LeBron's championships, but they're old enough that they're weary? Yeah, man. Sure. That's some grade-A spin. Who's writing this guy's lines?

>In one of 204 city courts that the _team helped renovate_, the Clippers were rolling out a refurbished, championship-style basketball team that feels like home.

lakers,hell,"Honestly I wish him well and I think his court vision and defensive abilities are great but I just can't see him turning his shot around. Obviously you root like hell for them when they are Lakers but even when he was I couldn't defend his shooting. I don't think you can go from 41% at the line to something serviceable. I don't think he's ever going to be a good shooter with the only possible exception being if he literally strips his form down to nothing and rebuilds it. His career slash is 38/31/43. thats almost historically bad. 

There is always this expectation with Lonzo, we did it with Ingram too, that all of a sudden he's just gonna click and start bombing shots and scoring points but I've got no idea why. Ingram hasn't shown his shooting touch from college and neither has Lonzo. If they slash the same next year you kind of have to start thinking that they are what they are. It would be historically unprecedented in this league for Lonzo so become even a serviceable shooter. That is how bad his shooting has been so far. Nobody goes from 41 percent at the line to even 60 percent, it's never been done. And its not like 60 percent is a good percentage its pretty terrible.

I think Lonzo has a place in this league. I think he can defend superbly and he can run an offense on the break as good as anybody in the league. But I don't think he's a max player when this contract ends and I certainly don't think he is going to impact the league in any huge way as in getting All NBA nods or MVPs or anything. 

This is before we get into the fact that he can't stay on the court. He has played in 99 of 164 games. Thats pretty terrible durability. I'm also fairly certain his ankle injury from last year was misreported because stories are out saying he still hasn't healed from it and he went down in February. They reported a grade 3 ankle sprain. Now everybody heals differently but Andrelton Simmons of the Angels got a grade 3 sprain and was back playing in around 5-6 weeks. I don't doubt we sat him at the end of the year to avoid tanking his trade value but I also think his injury was worse than they told us. 

What he is good at, he is good enough at to secure his future playing pro ball but I don't regret trading any of them for AD for even a second. I won't regret it in another 5 years when they'll supposedly be peaking (though AD will only be 31/32 himself then). We were not going to win with those guys and we did not have time to wait for them to develop. I'm sorry but the moment we signed LeBron on his own the writing was on the wall that we would do what we did this summer which was trade most of the youth for a top player and build around the duo. AD is a top 10 player at least, entering his prime. You trade whatever it takes to get a guy like that. Period.",07-27-2019,1564221346.0

& while his rotations and staffing choices were absolute sh*t, the front office did him no favors by not giving him the personnel they knew he‚Äôd succeed with; shooters.

lakers,hell,"I respect the hell out of him outside of basketball, but there is still plenty to complain about around basketball.  He is one of the laziest players I've ever seen on defense.  He refuses to run an actual offense.  He is a terrible leader.  Look at how he destroyed the team last year with the AD stuff and the way he treated his teammates.  The man will end up being the all time leader in turnovers by the end of his career, but heaven forbid one of his teammates make a bad pass or miss a shot.  My dislike for the player was never a Kobe versus Lebron thing.  I've never enjoyed his game.  He dominates the ball like no other which of course leads to stats and is boring to watch.  He cares way too much about his image and brand which is why he won't jump with anyone at the rim for fear of being dunked on and it being a looped highlight.  I've been a Laker fan for over 35 years and last season was the least enjoyable season of my life mostly because of him.  I preferred the 17 win team a few years back.",07-28-2019,1564330842.0

lakers,shit,"I like how only in the NBA you can't have injuries. And if you have you need to comeback right after and be exactly the same or you are washed. 

Same thing with Kevin Durant, he will have time to recover from the injury and then, like any normal person would suppose, he will have to get rehab. But that's not it, media just make it like you need to comeback and in the same day play and play your best. If you think a little more that's what happened to him in the play offs, he goes out almost a month and cameback to play in the next day that he started to train again.

If you are a little in on the European football scene you would know that players usually don't comeback and play right after, they do a lot of conditioned training before they ever put a foot on a game (the clubs normally are the ones that don't let the players play for they sake, that's what happens when you put your own money on the table and not the league), unless is a minor injury. And normally players don't comeback on top form for the rest of the season. In the US it's like the media, fans and etc demand all that irrational things.

I can‚Äôt fucking wait for teams to recognize that there is not one team in the west who has an answer for what bron and AD are about to do. Not one. You can jam lanes and stay tight on the perimeter to slow down guards. What the fuck are you going to do to slow down anthony Davis and lebron james? Stack th paint?

Brown testified that on August 7, 2004, she was solicited for sex by Johnny Mitchell Allen, 43, who picked her up and drove her back to his house. There, Brown saw a gun cabinet in Allen‚Äôs room, she said during her trial. She resisted him until he appeared to reach under the bed, at which point she believed he was going to kill her. Brown took a gun out of her purse and shot Allen, killing him.

During her trial, the prosecution argued that the motive for the killing was not self-defense, as Brown claimed, but rather robbery, since Brown took Allen‚Äôs wallet after she shot him. She was convicted of first-degree murder, first degree felony murder and aggravated robbery. The convictions carried concurrent life sentences and eight additional years.",08-02-2019,1564768525.0

Jokic isn‚Äôt even in the top 10 for rebounds this year which has been immensely superior to his two prior, and embiid was on a pitch count for the last two years prior to this one.

More steals than Lebron and klay is ridiculous I won‚Äôt even delve into that any further.

More blocks than Drummond and giannis: Andre Drummond never cracked the top 5 in those 3 seasons and in 16-17 was 28th on the list in bpg .  Giannis also never cracked the top 5 and not surprisingly with his increased offensive workload dropped to 10th this year.

The NBA **needs** there to be two legitimate teams in LA otherwise superstars would be forcing their way into the Lakers every couple of years, and at least with another team in LA they can diffuse the talent and create some semblance of parity. Looking back its so fucking absurd /r/nba was arguing that LA was not a desirable market or that stars didn't care to live and play here.

lakers,fuck,"The number 1 rule of racial humor, or any controversial humor, is that it better be fucking funny. You broke the rule.

To put my analyzing cap on, I think that rule must come from an unspoken understanding that if it's funny then you are probably playing off something most people have heard of and just taking advantage of it in order to make people laugh. However, if you fall short of that humor it's probably because it came off like a personal opinion and there will be all kinds of assumptions about your ignorance, possibly rightfully so.

Exhibit A above.

Edit: Just to be clear, professional comedians make controversial racial jokes all the time. So if you think what I'm saying is something problematic, I'm just commenting on the nature of comedy. Think of Chris Rock, Louis CK, KT Tatara or PK, etc., etc.

Edit 2: I'd like a downvoter to actually explain to me why I'm being downvoted. Did you like the joke and are offended that I criticized it? Are you offended that I suggested that racial humor can actually be done right? Explain.",08-08-2019,1565271925.0

lakers,shit,"This is tough to answer. But basically, it comes way more down to the medium that the footage was delivered on, than what cameras they used. The cameras they used were no doubt millions of dollars back then. The problem is the best mediums at the time (NTSC and VHS) are trash compared to today‚Äôs standards, and this footage was likely ripped off a VHS tape. If the NBA were to take the raw footage and release it on today‚Äôs mediums, I have no doubt it would look incredible. The problem is it seems the NBA isn‚Äôt interested in doing that, so old footage like this just gets ripped off of whatever horrible medium it was originally released on, and reposted.

The old 1920‚Äôs footage you‚Äôre referring to has likely been remastered for today‚Äôs mediums. If you were to watch it off a VHS tape, it would look like shit.

I met MWP twice. The first time was at Whole Foods in Brentwood a few weeks before the 2010 playoffs started (championship year!).

Second, I couldn‚Äôt speak well because of the tooth extraction lol.

If you hang out in Manhattan Beach/El Segundo you‚Äôll run into a lot of guys. I saw Steve Nash/Nick Young/Klay/D‚ÄôAntoni (boo) there. More recently I saw Reggie Bullock at the in n out by the UCLA Health Center three days before free agency started. His license plate was his IG handle which I found to be interesting lol. I didn‚Äôt say anything to any of the guys I listed here. I‚Äôve worked in the entertainment industry for the past 10 yrs so most run ins aren‚Äôt that big of a deal and I know these guys/girls don‚Äôt want to be disturbed.

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",08-09-2019,1565376336.0

He then went to the Bucks who were the last place team in the eastern conference (15-67) the year before he got there. The following year they made it to the playoffs as a sixth seed. They drafted Jabari Parker and he never really panned out and got injured, Giannis was still developing and if you looked at the Bucks this year they don‚Äôt really have a second star. Middleton barely made the all star team and he wouldn‚Äôt come close to making it on the team in the western conference. And there was actually a lot of turnover this past year on the Bucks. You remember Brook Lopez? Yea he plays for them. How about Mirotic? He got traded there mid season. George Hill another guy they added in a trade last year. The reason the Bucks had an amazing year wasn‚Äôt because Kidd isn‚Äôt the coach anymore it‚Äôs because Giannis developed into and MVP and they surrounded him with shooters.

however YOU SIR, this was special...... cuz not only does it appear that you started off with an attempt to qualify your point preemptively, but you seemingly attempted one of those retarded transparent group manipulation tactics, most often heard in arguments that are being lost, thus people resort to phrases such as ""Even a blind man can see I am right, it's that obvious"" and other similar, blatant tells that person is full of shit...........however, rarely do you see people voluntarily go down that road........also the irony in insulting people for a perceived lack of intellegence based on them being younger than 25 sounding like a fucking 12 year old, is appreciated (oh and no worries, Ive gained a few more years of smart since being 25 so you know I'm the real deal).  

However, after, you proceed to emphatically give your opinion on a manner as if your opinion is actually absolute, YOUR 'MIC DROP' WINNER IS .....RING COUNTING??? ......... You do realize that Pop has 5 right? You also realize that Phil had nothing to do with inventing or creating the triangle? You do realize that both these coaches have polar opposite styles?........Oh and you clearly have no fucking clue how the triangle is run with that 'cores' shit....

oh if you get a chance, do me a favor tell me definitively whose the best ever Tyson, Ali, or Mayweather ... thanks

lakers,shit,Yes . Michael Jordan didn‚Äôt win shit until Phil arrived that explains a lot . Also many people forget about that,08-10-2019,1565469939.0

lakers,shit,"I mean, personally, I‚Äôd still take the tickets. When I first read signed Kobe‚Äôs, I thought they were Kobe‚Äôs signed by Kobe - and in my head I was like ‚Äúoh shit, that‚Äôs legit.‚Äù Then I realized they were Kobe‚Äôs signed by Josh Hart, and my enthusiasm for this guys haul went down hill immediately. Practice gear (probably not in his size) and shoes signed by Josh Hart (that he‚Äôll never wear) doesn‚Äôt even come close to the same value great game tickets have. But to each their own.",08-10-2019,1565478275.0

lakers,crap,"What a koad of crap. Point by point.

Also, speculating much? Ok.. Let's say, LeBron doesn't come. Then we could sign Kawhi outrigjt. Have the young core and a max slot to land...let's say KD... or PG...or... you get the drift.",08-10-2019,1565474387.0

lakers,damn,Lol damn what‚Äôs up with Kuz? Why can‚Äôt he just have confidence in himself? I don‚Äôt see a problem with him believing in himself when everybody‚Äôs counting him out and saying how he can‚Äôt do this and that.,08-10-2019,1565485413.0
lakers,shit,"The difference is LeBron has turned crazy work ethic into championships and every other accolade.

Other than being a good scorer Kuz hasn‚Äôt done shit yet. The only reason he‚Äôs popular is because he‚Äôs relatable to young fans. 

If he gets rid of that ridiculous haircut, stops living up Jeanie‚Äôs ass, and turns those workouts into defense and wins then us doubters will become fans.",08-11-2019,1565496169.0
lakers,shit,"Is this what we are doing now? Prepping early so we have some shit to argue about during the season since there are no more lines to draw about the young prospects and Kuz is the only one left?  

Just give it a rest already.  Kuz is either gonna be good or not.  The media is obviously going to pinpoint his potential because he is still new to the league and has an ""unknown"" factor about him.  The same way people are pumping up NO's with our previous players.  

Wait until we get more FIBA footage to start this lol.",08-11-2019,1565508590.0
lakers,crap,"I‚Äôm with you. I just hope Kuz makes a huge leap. He just might considering how much work he is putting in and how badly he wants to get better. Not all players have that drive. I was higher on Lonzo big time and still am but I am having less confidence in his 3 pointers coming around due to his crappy form. And BI, I had hope he would get a lot better, and he did, but I feel he will never get to elite status because of his inability to put on muscle mass and his very slender frame. So, basically, I have more optimism for Kuz and less for the other former Laker kids. As for Hart, I just see him being a rotation piece.",08-10-2019,1565490731.0

lakers,shit,Dude stop imagining shit. Lonzo and Ingram are better than Kuzma point blank peroid. If he was the best assest NOLA would have gotten him no question. Imagine thinking NOLA would trade AD a generational talent to us and not get our best assest which you think is Kuz. L O FUCKING L,08-10-2019,1565494517.0
lakers,damn,Are we still on this in August??? The young guys are gone. Kuz works hard to let just want and see how he improves. Like damn. The smear hate is strong.,08-10-2019,1565495044.0

lakers,fuck,"Very happy. I still think he could have been a valuable role player on our squad if it wasn't for the unfortunate stuff with his mom. I hope he gets a few more years in the NBA. But this does make me curious, what the fuck did Carmelo do to get this level of treatment? I know Beasley statistically is far superior in terms of advanced stats and stuff but Carmelo could still fill seats if he went to a losing team like Charlotte for example.",08-10-2019,1565493304.0

This shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone. Look at Kahwi and PG. those clowns will leave the clippers when they don‚Äôt win shit. This is the players only NBA,08-10-2019,1565495645.0
