Funnelling Harden to Gobert is an excellent idea in theory, but they need to find a way to ensure that Gordon and House aren't waiting in the corner for an open 3. Additionally they need to stick to Harden closer so Gobert doesn't need to extend away from Capela as much.

Defensively, they wanted to take away Harden‚Äôs left and force him to drive to the basket for a right handed floater. Sounds good and if you see Harden‚Äôs shot chart it could‚Äôve been a lot worse. They took away his biggest weapon - the step back 3. 

Problem is doing this puts Gobert in no mans land. Now he either tries to block Harden and give up the open oop to Capela or give Harden a semi contested layup. Many times they tried to get greedy and have Gobert step up to challenge Harden and have a weak side defender by the paint to disrupt the oop to Capela.  

Problem no 2 then comes in - Harden is a great passer and easily kick out to the open man for a 3. Now if they‚Äôre missing the 3, the game plan seems good but more often than not the Rockets will hit open 3s.

But literally, all Utah has to do is have each of those guys hit one more three (they have the ability and they had the open looks) and the game is 108-110 at the timeout where we cleared the bench.

Also, cut out these turnovers, and you can limit the following scoring opportunities:


* Donovan Mitchell steps out of bounds turnover (1st Quarter, 8:06) leads to Capela 2pt shot


* Ricky Rubio steps out of bounds turnover (1st Quarter, 7:14) leads to Harden stepback 3


* Derrick Favors lost ball turnover (Chris Paul steals) (1st Quarter, 2:27) leads to Faried 2pt dunk


* Joe Ingles out of bounds bad pass turnover (1st Quarter, 1:58) leads to House 3pt shot


* Rudy Gobert lost ball turnover (PJ Tucker steals) (2nd Quarter, 6:28) leads to Harden 2pt shot


* Donovan Mitchell lost ball turnover (Austin Rivers steals) (3rd Quarter, 1:53) leads to Faried dunk


* Georges Niang bad pass (Austin Rivers steals) (4th Quarter, 1:16) leads to Rivers 2pt shot.

Those are only the turnovers that directly resulted in points on the other end (only 7 TOs), but that's 16 pts that came directly from turnovers in this game, so we basically spotted Houston 16 points in the game. The 11 other turnovers, while not directly leading to points still limited our ability to score and put too much pressure on our defense. 

Hit a basic expectation of threes from the group at large, and the game is close in the 4th. Cut out even half of the turnovers, and this game is even closer than that, with a likely Jazz victory.",04-15-2019,1555308313.0

Why? Cp3 is gonna be ass in the next 2 years and his contract is going to be an albatross for years to come, limiting the Rox on who they can put behind Harden.

Steph is 31 this year, and, especially if KD dipps, the Warriors dynasty will have to end in the next 3 years, sooner depending on what happens.

After those two teams, who's got next? The Nuggets are tantalizingly talanted but (in my opinion) pretty overrated and haven't won a playoff series in a decade--I could be wrong and Denver might be incredibly good but only time will tell.

utahjazz,hell,"I'd love to see our Jazz win a Title, but the facts are - the NBA is a business that needs to maximize revenue.

What I mean by that, is after watching the Tim Donaghy interviews on YouTube, the fact that Stern has said himself that ""the best Finals would be a Lakers vs. Lakers matchup,"" how the NBA jobbed the Kings in the Sacramento vs. Lakers Series those years back, etc., etc., etc., you have to see it as ""business decisions"" when it comes to the Jazz.

Mitchell would have to become Jordan 2.0, and even then, the NBA would be pushing him to become a Laker, etc.

If everything was equal, and the market you played in wasn't a factor, then yes, I could see the Jazz winning one eventually.

Even when we had the amazing duo of Stockton and Malone, the NBA turned a blind eye to its money maker pushing off on Bryan Russell with ""the shot"" against the Jazz.

In short - it's all about money and star power. Hoops is way too easy to control with ""Fouls"" from the Refs that turn the tides in games. 

The NBA doesn't want to see Utah represent the West, they'd rather have Golden State or the Lakers face the East's best money maker. 

In short, for Utah to even have an opportunity at seeing a Finals, the Jazz would need Mitchell to become a Jordan 2.0 for it to happen.",04-16-2019,1555443449.0
utahjazz,hell,"I think the Jazz are always trying to build teams to win it all, and they get dang close, but come up short by just a single player usually.   The extra downside is that missing player is usually the piece that only certain clubs can pick up because of their championship history, market, or just extreme draft luck.

With this Jazz team as it is, they literally only need to sign 1 more significant scoring threat, and they win, that is it!  It's crazy to think how easy the Jazz would have it with literally just 1 more major consistent scoring option.

But sadly it's just so hard to convince players to come to Utah.  They won the freaking lottery somehow getting Favors, Ingles, Gobert, and Mitchell together at their peaks, 4 guys with old school work ethic, and loyalty.  Just 1 more scoring threat is all they need.  However I am not optimistic they can draft a scoring threat in time for this team to stay to together/their peak, nor trade for one while retaining everyone necessary.

The only way they can take the next step is to sign a free agent, and sadly the bias against playing in Utah is real among players.  

It's interesting though, every player that plays here (with the exception of Enes who was jealous Rudy was better and took his spot) loves Utah, and wants to come back. It's only the players that haven't come here who don't want to.",04-16-2019,1555447133.0
utahjazz,shit,"The fact that the best team in the league has Giannis on it is proof that yes it can happen.  Big markets are used as an excuse.  Look at the Lakers, they‚Äôve been shit the last six years. Before being a dynasty, Golden state was a joke of a franchise.  The spurs are a small market team like the Jazz and have had a historical dynastic run.  It‚Äôs about building a world class organization and the players will come.  We are on our way.  Might happen might not, but there are still small markets that thrive, and players that want to be a part of those types of winning cultures.",04-16-2019,1555439179.0

I think we have until the 20-21 season to try.  After that, Gobert, Mitchell, and Ingles contracts expire, and I'm not sure we can afford Mitchell, Gobert, and a super max player from that point on.  

This FO deserves to give their fans an elite product, not a pretty good product, even if it means we will have to rebuild after 20-21.  We will always be loyal fans.  Give us a legitimate chance at a championship in return.",04-16-2019,1555447044.0
utahjazz,hell,"Honestly, I have no idea. There's 30 teams vying for it every single year. So many things have to go right in order to win it all.

A championship would be great, but it's not what I watch for. This is my favorite Jazz roster, despite the fact that they're not as good as the Malone/Stockton era that I grew up watching.

I just want to watch competitive basketball and a group of guys that plays as a team, and thankfully that's what we have. We have Gobert and Mitchell to build on so there's a possibility we get better, but there are no guarantees. A player may demand a trade or suffer a career-ending (or at least career-derailing) injury or something else.

utahjazz,fuck,"If Gilbert ever passed he'd realize that half the reason you force harden right is to mess up his ability to make a play off the drive. If you give him an automatic defensive rotation AND his left hand he can pick you apart like Tom Brady.

The ACTUAL problem with the execution was the help defense. The rotations to where Harden wanted to pass were slow and they were often wrong. I was not surprised when Ricky said they need to learn the game plan more and they'll get better at it as the series goes along, that's exactly what it looked like. One second slow on the rotations or a little confusion or hesitation and you're fuckin roasted. 

The 3 day break is a huge help, we need practice time. Now changing philosophy to start the playoffs is the real questionable choice, we might have over thought it. But we'll see. We could've won that game with a couple more timely threes and less brutally timed turnovers. It wasn't all that out of reach. Even Favors dropped a pass, not sure if I saw that all year.

utahjazz,fuck,"I think we're just so far behind, especially with personnel. Our floor is high thanks to skilled/disciplined players, solid team play, and a defensive scheme that works against most teams. However, in my opinion, our ceiling is low because we don't have a hyper-efficient scorer (Giannis, Harden, Curry/KD come to mind), our defense can be exploited (because a good offense can usually beat a good defense and speed can beat our defense) and our athleticism has a pretty stiff upper bound. Furthermore, our transition defense is pretty bad (it would look even worse if we didn't foul early in every fast break, which is smart play all things considered) and all the missed long-range shots only exacerbate this.

The Rockets represent one of our worst matchups, in my opinion. They have four guys who are reasonably fast and can switch, and Capela, who's no slouch either. This is in contrast with our relatively slow (and by slow, I mean laterally) lineups. To beat it, we'd need Gobert/Favors to suck up all the rebounds and get putbacks and our shooters to hit clean 3's.

Not having a dedicated Harden stopper is rough, too. Dude is nigh unguardable, and then there's CP3 on top of that. There's inevitably someone open when our defense helps in the paint and they (mostly PJ Tucker) have been hitting their 3's. On the other end, we need someone who can break down their defense. Normally, this would be Donovan (or Rubio/Jingles), but all of them are most effective driving in order to get their advantage, and the Rockets' team defense (and our lack of knockdown shooters) is making this incredibly difficult.

That said, I still want to see us win, because fuck the Rockets. It will be an uphill battle, and I think Quin will have to make some adjustments, considering we don't have the right personnel for the defense we're trying to play. I think I said this somewhere else, but some of our key points to victory include getting their bigs in foul trouble by way of Gobert/Favors dominating the paint, using more PnR with Mitchell/Gobert or Jingles/Gobert to create mismatches, and making open 3's.

utahjazz,hell,"The rockets are the jazz kryptonite. They are literally built to beat our team. And it‚Äôs one of the most effective ways to build in the league right now.  Not much we can do right now unless Houston just doesn‚Äôt play like they play.

Edit: it‚Äôs not the hardest to defend against our offense. The Houston defense is literally built to defend our type of offense. Houston hasn‚Äôt had to change anything the jazz have to do a different offense than what they normally do against the other 28 teams in the league. I‚Äôm not doubting Quin we literally do not have the personnel to be competitive. I love ingles but he can‚Äôt handle pressure all the time in his face like this. Mitchell is getting shredded because he is playing 1v5 when he enters the paint he can‚Äôt do much. Our shooters aren‚Äôt hitting shots. The team is being manhandled because we don‚Äôt have the individual offensive producers to keep up.",04-18-2019,1555560291.0
utahjazz,hell,"Our ""blender"" pass-first offense is very similar to GS's offense- and that's exactly who Houston was built to go up against. The difference is they have the individual offensive producers that you mention we don't. And it really does become about just hitting your shots against them- and that's why GS will beat them and we can't very easily.

We beat them twice this year in a blow-out and a still solid win, but Harden was the only good player on the court in both of those games, and in the second he was below average (for him). Paul was out for the first one, they didn't have Nene, they didn't have Farried. Mitchell went for 38 that game. Ingles, Rubio, and Crowder went a combined 7/28 that game- it's a miracle we  won. Then the second game, Houston shot 38.6%, 22.2% from 3. Harden lead the team in scoring with 15. Meanwhile, the Jazz combined for 50.6% on the backs of Favors and Ingles with 24 and 18, respectively. 

*Can* we beat them? Yes. Is it possible if we shoot under 40% like we have in all four losses to them this year? Absolutely not.

So here we are, back to your main point: we need consistent offensive prowess to compete with Houston and GS in the post season.

utahjazz,damn,"tbh Quin has to make the hard calls for this series.

&#x200B;

1, you can't have Rudy and Derrick on at the same time, really no point of starting both together as it is a waste of a spot at the start or 1st and 2nd half. you need 3 wings that can space the floor and i'd prob go with Royce starting with Mitchell and Ingles on the wings with him.

&#x200B;

2, Prob gonna get me hated, Rudy is just no match when Capella has Harden on the floor, Rudy having to sag and the help defender is leaving the open 3. for this series Favors is prob the better option to go with.

&#x200B;

3, i been saying this since game 1 started, let harden have his career nights, defend him 1 v 1 and don't let Gordon, House, Tucker etc get theirs. let them stay cold and let harden tire himself out through out the game. defend the 3 and the paint and only give up the mid range. i remember when the clock would count down at that start of the year and harden would just dribble and when it hits the 5th or 4th second then try to double him.  where did that go?

&#x200B;

4, set hard screens on harden, try to tire him out by making him run through those screens. 

&#x200B;

5, the Boys need to grow a pair, it is bloody Playoff Basketball, gonna foul then bloody foul them. As much as people hate on Draymond Green at least when he fouls he lets them know. 

&#x200B;

that my opinion.

&#x200B;

now in all honesty, this series clearly shows that we are just not that talented enough to go 7 games against the rockets. let be honest.

Rubio - is cool and all but lets be real with ourselves, he not gonna get the job done. does so many awesome things on and off the court. he needs to be surrounded by shooters.

Mitchell -  just needs to go kobe, doesn't matter if he bricks i'd rather him fail by missing then just not doing a damn thing.

Ingles - needs to grow a pair, he just a no show.

Favors - consistent and is like the only guy doing what he has done all year. 

Rudy - same as Joe, Grow a pair.

O'Neale - Love the effort can't complain to much about him, Harden is just a beast.

Crowder - really haven't notice him throughout the playoffs, he just there.

At times he even looks hesitant to take the easy layup when given to him.  Opposing teams can gameplan around this easily.  You take away his passing lanes and suddenly he's a nonfactor, entirely.  He's 100% my top trade priority.  I'd be crushed to see Ingles outside of a Jazz jersey, but I'm so torn on his effectiveness.  If he was a bit more athletic with some speed and lateral quickness I'd be okay with him leading the offense at the 1 permanently.

utahjazz,hell,"From HTX as well. Honestly I think Mitchell shows great promise and has a high ceiling but I think he might be feeling the pressure to perform and be a leader a bit. I think he‚Äôs facing the wall that Harden faced when he first came to Houston. To be a leader, perform well, etc. Harden  progressed  to be a better player and has learned how to become a leader in his own way. I think if Mitchell (and Snyder) figures out what he needs to work on to get to that next level, both on and off the court, he will be sensational. Both as a player and leader. 

Didn‚Äôt follow Mitchell too much in college nor do I follow the jazz closely so the above is all speculation. I have to ask jazz fans was he known as a leader before entering the league? Is he an outspoken person? Are the vets trying to to mentor him or is there some strife on the team right now because I recall reading a tweet or article about how some of the players weren‚Äôt on board with Snyder‚Äôs strategy against the rockets this series.

Perhaps he‚Äôs the type of player to lead by example and actions or some other method. The way he played tonight did look like it he was trying to send a message to both the rockets and his team. And it looked like it really motivated his team. 

Overall great game guys and good luck in game 4.

2, The league and the owners are realizing that the CBA doesn't protect teams from keeping star players.  Every small market team wants to keep their star players.

utahjazz,hell,"I don't think they could sign Mike Conley, but I think saying that signing him isn't close to enough is exaggerating.  Just 1 more major scoring threat is definitely *close to enough*.  Because the problem with the Jazz is they really only have one major scoring threat, and Mitchell is still so inexperienced, he isn't entirely at his full potential yet anyways.The jazz will occasionally get lucky with one of the other guys on a rotational basis. But that isn't enough.  

So if the Jazz somehow had a 2nd major scoring threat, retaining their style of play and defense, taking the scoring burden from players like Ingles, or especially Crowder so he wouldn't have to jack up so many 3's, and others who just can't be relied on nightly, the Jazz are easily a very formidable team.  They should easily win 56+ games with 1 more major threat.

I think that covers almost the entire league and is close to enough.  But how you make that next leap to defacto be the best and able to beat anyone, I just don't know.  And I agree with you, I don't know if that's even possible, because like you said, Utah is not a FA spot.  The only way honestly is probably to win the lottery (drafting a skilled player, not #1 pick) with the draft again lol.  It's literally the only reason the Jazz were ever in the finals, and probably the only way they will get there again.",04-21-2019,1555894205.0

utahjazz,hell,"Thoughts from this game:

* Ricky was far more aggressive in terms of willingness to score.  I've said it many, many, times, he needs to be more of a threat to score.  I don't love the 3pt attempts from him, I'd rather see him drive and go for a floater/oop, or a dish to someone else that we actually want to shoot.  Nonetheless, I think it really started with him.
* Crowder and Faves came to play.  I wasn't sure I agreed with the Crowder start but this is why Quinn is a mad genius.  Great adjustment there.
* Royce continues to be a solid all around player.  He's one of the 4 I believe we absolutely want to keep.
* The all around defensive effort from the whole team is what won us this game (and should have won us last game).  It's never been done, but this series is not over if we can keep duplicating this defense.
* 4th quarter Mitchell is just so satisfying.  I really wish he'd start games with more of a midrange game to get his shot going and then expand as the game goes on.  This 3pt or drive stuff is getting predictable.  I might be overly critical of him in terms of offense, because I think the fact that our PnR game hasn't been clicking as much, till this game, is a factor towards his offensive effectiveness.",04-23-2019,1555996895.0

utahjazz,hell,"*long post*
Positives:
 Mitchell, and the Jazz, now know his weakness's. And what to build off of. He's going to be a star and we better hope he grows. He's no Westbrook he'll improve. 
 
O'Neale, he's going to be a big part for the Jazz in the future. He proved this whole series he deserves to be a starter imo.

Gobert gets better and better every year. He needs to work on his emotions. 

Favors is a beast. He needs more minutes. Utah does better when he's on the floor Imo

Rubio I know people are hate or love relationship with him. I'm a fan, and this series and season we've come to a conclusion that he is an important piece. Yeah he had his down games. But, he's a great asset to this team. 
 
Crowder is a great 6th man and I think if he takes more drives and less 3s his value grows

Exum man I don't know what the future holds for him, but before his ankle roll he was looking like the draft pick we thought Utah was getting. Hope he can come back and get a chance whether for Utah or another team. 

 Ingles sad how this season went for him.  I hope we get that pesky shut down PG Ingles and not 18-19 Ingles. Hoping it was just a thing.",04-24-2019,1556160258.0

that said if we can upgrade at pg we absolutely should. we def need more reliable outside shooting and someone that can create for themselves and the most likely position (with the most options) to do that in FA is with a new pg. 

for what its worth i would also look to add a starting sf and move ingles to the bench. love the guy but he regressed this season and im thinking less minutes would benefit him a ton, as well as make our bench that much better.

we need to add some scoring in a big way. i hope we go all in and get mitchell a second (and third) scorer to take some of the pressure off him.",04-25-2019,1556167145.0

The Jazz shot 23% on wide open 3s in the series and still kept Games 3 and 5 close while outright winning Game 4.  They managed that almost entirely because of what Rudy Gobert gives us:  The ability to shut down a historically elite offense.

Rudy Gobert is literally the last player on the team that should be getting shit on.  What he did was phenomenal - it's just a shame that horrific shooting from the rest of the team will prevent him from getting the recognition he deserves.",04-25-2019,1556227866.0

That being said, some people are absolute assholes about Dante. Have some empathy for the poor guy. I get that the guy makes a lot of money as a basketball player, but the dude still wanted to play basketball for his career and it would suck for anyone to not be able to play their career. He also worked hard when he wasn't injured to be better but everyone makes it seem like the dude didn't give any effort. Just before the injury in December he was starting to look like the point guard we had hoped he'd be. He was finishing at the rim better than Donovan, he was getting 13 assists, he was running the floor as well as Rubio, and he was playing great defense for us. This sub was starting to get hyped for his play. I honestly thought he'd be our third option.

Our star players are 22 and 26. We should not under any circumstances be looking at getting a player over thirty, unless that player is like Kevin Durant and can make the team a contender until Mitchell hits his prime.

Ill say the same thing about Love that I said about Conley and I still say about Kemba. The NBA 'prime' generally starts around 25-26 and ends 30-31. Ideally you want all your players primes to overlap for a least a year. If we sign a 31 year old player, they will be declining for their entire time on the team and will miss Mitchell's entire prime window. We'll waste years of Don's prime as a result of trying to rush our window, and years of Don's development teaching him to play alongside someone who won't be there when we're competing. Look at LA to see what happens when you sign a guy whose window doesn't match the team's.

It's far better for our team to sign a younger guy like Harris or even Mirotic, or even take a flyer on a bunch of Mitchell-aged guys with potential than it is to commit large amounts of money to a guy who doesn't sync up and isn't good enough to win it with us.",05-03-2019,1556907756.0

Regarding Rudy and supertax, that's a tough one. Rudy took slightly less than the max last contract, so maybe he's not set on the full supermax, assuming he's eligible. We've seen from other team that only 5‚Äì8 players are really ""worth"" the supermax, and it can be franchise-crippling on the wrong player.

They make it seem absurd as to if anyone would want to live here. Nearly all of our players do just fine living in UT. Sure it's not as exciting as LA or NY, but there are enough guys in this league that care about winning that it shouldn't be a problem.

Also, their minutes could be staggered so one of them is always on the floor, like Houston does with Paul and Harden. He costs less than Tobias and Kemba so the Jazz could afford to keep Favors and have a max or near max skit next year.",05-22-2019,1558499676.0
utahjazz,hell,"Hes really dynamic in the pick and roll. He is a really good ballhandler, would take a lot of pressure off Mitchell. He has a good amount of size for a point guard. He is young and I believe healthy. Lots to like to be honest",05-22-2019,1558503571.0
utahjazz,hell,"DLo would actually be my preferred FA acquisition, but of course it is entirely contingent on BKN getting 2 stars on max deals.. 

1. Youth: Donovan and Russell are friends off the court, they are of similar age, and can play here together for a very long time. Getting Gemba or Conley, we would be paying them into their mid 30's. Brogdon will be 27 next season. 

2. Upside: A Mitchell/Russell backcourt easily has the greatest upside. Kemba/Conley will likely decline around the third year of a 4 year deal. Russell and Mitchell have a lot of room for growth. The Jazz have a real possibility of having a 2 all-star guard tandem here.

3. Efficiency: While efficiency shouldn't be overlooked, it is important to remember that efficiency cannot quantify talent/potential, however you want to describe that. Context is also important. Neither Brooklyn nor Utah had a reliable second scoring option (especially Utah; Brooklyn's next best scorer is 6th man Spencer Dinwiddie). Conversely, Brogdon has a smaller role and a lower degree of difficulty with his shots than a Donovan or a Russell. Russell and Donovan both have their best days ahead of them, they can lead a team together. 

One more note on that, I think our fan base has the misfortune of having David Locke as an announcer and spewer of arbitrary stats. The guy just said on a podcast that the Jazz would be better having Garrett Temple next to Donovan than Kemba Walker. The guy gets caught up in analytics, and forgets to watch basketball in the process. 

4. $$: This is my speculation, my opinion, I can be completely wrong on this. I actually think it's quite possible that in terms of dollars, a DLo deal would be equal to (or less than) a deal w/ Tobias Harris. I also believe his deal would be lesser than a Kemba Walker, and cheaper than Conley's already-written contract. I'd rather spend low 20's-25 million on Russell than upwards of 15-28 million for Brogdon. More potential, more bang for your buck. 

In any case, I think in the long run, D'Angelo would actually be the best long-term option. 2 rising starts at the 1 and 2, the best rim protector in the nba, and other role players that play very good defense. Our floor would be what the Blazers are right now, and this plan provides the Jazz with the longest and highest ceiling.",05-22-2019,1558564431.0
utahjazz,damn,"Here's the thing about D'Angelo: until this year his teams have always been worse than Kemba, Tobias or Middleton. Kemba's is probably not the same, but it's undeniable Kemba is better than D'Angelo. The real sell on D'Angelo over Kemba is youth and the expectation that D'Angelo's only getting better.

Onto the other teams, Khris has had Giannis and Tobias has had Ben, Joel, tons of guys. D'Angelo's usage is so high because he's been literally the only player worth a damn since he was drafted up until now. Of course the rookie expected the team to be loaded onto his back is not going to be efficient.",05-22-2019,1558541955.0
utahjazz,hell,"I think we need a guy that doesn't need the ball and can knock down threes. 

For me, because Mitchell is gonna be the main ball handler, a Beverley type player would be my go to. 

Ricky is a great ball handler and can facilitate but he can't shoot that well. 

I think we should throw a contract at Beverley, he's the best option for me considering market 'size' and he fits the roster, small contract too.

If we‚Äôre going to get another 20 PPG scorer, it‚Äôs very likely going to be through a trade or another Mitchell-esque lucky draft pick.  Small market teams really just don‚Äôt ever sign major free agents that aren‚Äôt incumbents.  Tobias will very likely get maxed and stay in Philly. Kemba will likely get supermaxed and stay in Charlotte.

utahjazz,hell,"Mitchell will be getting maxed out. He's up for a contract extension next summer. Next summer he could sign a five-year $168 million contract. (This is an estimate, since the max amounts haven't been released past the 2023-2024 season). He would start getting paid in the 2021-22 season and would be signed through the 2025-2026 season. Technically since we drafted him and we have rights, we can sign up all the way up to the luxury tax limit (this next year, it's $132 million. We can expect it to be around $159 million for the 2021-22 season).

&#x200B;

The point I'm getting at, is if Rudy gets the supermax and we sign Donovan to the max, that would be a 5-year $270 million deal for Rudy and a 5-year $168 million deal for Donovan. About $87.6 million each year just for those two. Since the salary cap will be about $136 million in the 2021-2022 season, we'd still have about $48.4 million to fill out the roster without even touching luxury tax.",05-23-2019,1558653381.0

>Being that we are relatively close to New York, when you were drafted the Knicks passed on you. Do you ever wonder what would have happened if you went there?

>*It‚Äôs funny. That‚Äôs the one question I get nowadays. Would you want to be a Knick? For me, I‚Äôm a big believer in everything happens for a reason. Obviously, I thought there was a chance. But I knew they were really high on Frank (Ntilikina), who I‚Äôm really close with, so I didn‚Äôt really take it personally. I didn‚Äôt really get upset because I loved Utah when I went to work out and it was amazing. I was really excited when I got drafted, and the main thing for me, especially now at my age, it‚Äôs nice to be in New York, but it‚Äôs a big city. There‚Äôs always something to do. In Utah it‚Äôs not as big, people are right there on top of you. It‚Äôs amazing. They treat you amazing in Utah. Not to say they wouldn‚Äôt in New York, but I think in Utah it gives you that peace of mind because I‚Äôve been around the skyscrapers and the buildings my whole life. When I get to Utah I can sit on a mountaintop and somebody or a family will walk up and we can just sit and have a conversation. I think it‚Äôs not even the fact of me being who I am, but it‚Äôs just a different vibe, and I really appreciate them for that. They also give you space. In New York, it gets a little hectic sometimes (laughs), but in Utah, if I‚Äôm out to eat, they‚Äôll say, ‚ÄòWe appreciate what you do,‚Äô and keep going. Yeah, there is always that, what if? There are always those what ifs? I actually thought I was getting drafted by Charlotte, so there are always those what ifs?*

> I know you interact with a lot of guys on Twitter. I saw the tweets with Kyle Kuzma. I‚Äôm curious if you being the face more or less of the Utah Jazz if you go out and try to help recruit players at all?

>*Yeah, kind of. I think the biggest thing for me is I‚Äôm only in Year 2, so this is more so trying to understand, yeah I‚Äôm friends with a lot of guys and I‚Äôm not shy of showing it on social media, but a lot of it is just understanding it comes up in talks, but I haven‚Äôt really pitched someone. I haven‚Äôt done that. I haven‚Äôt been able to do that. There‚Äôs never been an opportunity for that because a lot of it has been just jokes. You know what I mean? Like I said, I‚Äôm still learning how this process goes. I‚Äôm still learning about how the salary cap works, and I‚Äôm still figuring that stuff out, so for me to be able to recruit and be invested, I want to make sure I come with my knowledge and not just saying, ‚ÄòOh, let‚Äôs do this,‚Äô and it not be a good fit at all.

>*Definitely a championship. The individual stuff I think takes care of itself with winning. Obviously, it‚Äôs easy to say I want to win MVP. It‚Äôs easy to say you want to be an All-Star. It really starts in summers like this. Winning takes care of everything. I don‚Äôt come into a season saying I need to be an All-Star this year or I need to get a new contract this year.

I agree on the others. The Spurs are at the end of a long cycle and Pop seems almost disinterested in basketball so it's hard to judge that. OKC has been badly managed although going for PG was a bold move that worked out. Hou built a team that probably should have won the title last season but Morey has been kind of hit and miss.

Cap hell is like that. You know you're going to be in pain 2-4 years down the road--but you have a chance now to take your odds of winning the title from 3% to 15% (or whatever). Do you take it?

You're not really allowed to evaluate that decision based on what happened after. That's all hindsight. Especially in a situation like this were no matter what only 1 out of 30 teams wins that title--1 out of maybe 6 teams that had a legitimate shot that year. So even if you take the plunge, your odds aren't good.

OKC and HOU are both in the prime years of the best stars they've had in a while. And they decided to go all-in.

-  AD desperately wanted out of NOLA, even wearing a ""That's all folks"" shirt to the last home game. BUT does the addition of Zion make him want to stay?

- Will NOLA want to keep Davis to play along side Zion or is there too much overlap?

- If they do trade AD would they see a Favors/Exum plus picks as a better compliment to Zion and be more willing to deal Jrue?

- What if they trade AD for something crazy AND Zion to someone else looking to make him the focal point of their franchise?

I grew up in Utah and we moved from the state when I was 15 years old (I'm 32 now) and I've been in California ever since, while I left the states dominate religion behind. I never stopped being a hardcore Jazz fan. I started playing in Jr. Jazz (Utah's premier youth rec bball organization) when I was 5 years old (the youngest age they allow) and played every year until I was too old. This gave me (nosebleed) tickets to one Jazz game a year as a kid, and I also went to a few of the player meet ups (the players I met were never too exciting. John Crotty, Adame Keefe, and Jamie Watson are the ones I remember) they they offer through the league. One of my favorite memories growing up is when Stockton sent the Utah Jazz to the NBA finals. There was a roar across the entire Salt Lake Valley. People came out of their houses banging pots and pans and cheering. I was inside watching the games, but I had some friends who were outside when the moment happened, and they said they heard such an uproar from the entire neighborhood that they had to rush in to see what had happened! If there's one thing you can say about Utah, it's that they LOVE their basketball. Before Real Salt Lake it was the ONLY major sports team in the state. Also, the Mormon church has played right into supporting a basketball team. The church runs its own youth and adult basketball leagues and has a full to 3/4 size basketball court in basically everyone of their chapels. Church basketball is almost just as competitive as high school basketball (or at least it was 17 years ago, things might have changed as demographics have shifted). By comparison, living in San Diego county, almost no one cares about basketball, I have a hard time finding coworkers interested in discussing it with me. People here only care about soccer and football, and that's it. To be honest, I'm not even sure how the Padres have managed to remain successful in San Diego.

I've been waiting my entire life for the Jazz to win a championship. It's the one thing left I need to happen before I can die happy. As someone who watched through the Stockton/Malone era, I haven't been able to taste a championship so close until we drafted Mitchell. I think right now we are so freaking close, and just knocking on the door of being able to win a championship. I don't know if my health can stand another window closing on us without a championship to be perfectly honest.

As for my non-basketball interests/hobbies/music taste:

Interests: 49ers, Final Fantasy 7, Exmormonism, The Orville, Crypocurrency (esp. XRP), engineering (I'm a plastic injection molder)

Hobbies: Video Games, Non-fiction books (real-life political intrigue like Red Notice, and autobiographies like Stockton's Assisted), smoking weed.

Ingles & O‚ÄôNeale are elite defenders all tied together by the best defender in the game in Rudy. Oh Conley is also a 20 ppg scorer that has had no back court spacing in his career like Donovan.

utahjazz,hell,"I want us to get the deal done. If we could get Conley for Exum + Bradley + 1 or 2 firsts we become significantly better. Its my understanding that in that scenario we can keep Favors and run it back with Conley, Mitchell, Ingles, Favors and Gobert. Crowder, Royce, Niang, Ekpe and Allen on the bench. We would have waived & stretched Korver and waived Neto and go sign a MLE for 4.7M and minimums to fill the rest of the spots. That team seems significantly better than last year IMO.

Do be completely honest this would be the quickest way for us to send us to the bottom of the west standings.

Gobert is literally the most important reason we have won so many games over the past 3 years and is literally a 1 man defense. If we get one of the players Utah is interested in (Conley, Harris, DLo) it will make the whole team better.

Let's start by talking about the Guard spot where there's a glut of talent - here are the guaranteed all-star guards in my opinion.

1. Steph
2. Harden
3. Dame

Here are all the borderline all-star guards, who will be competing for the two potential open spots

1. Mitchell
2. Conley
3. Doncic
4. DeRozan
5. Booker
6. McCollum
7. Westbrook

That's some staunch competition here, but just on pure numbers we're definitely favorites to get at least one into the two open spots.

As far as forward/center goes, I have Gobert as an absolute lock for the ASG next year barring something horribly awry. He was absolutely a huge snub this year and there was tons of visible outrage over it, so I imagine that he'll be voted in next year just because people are more aware of him.


We almost certainly won't get three all-stars, but I wouldn't surprised to see two. If Mitchell takes the next step with Conley there to back him up, and starts going nuclear, and becomes an MVP caliber player, then maybe we could see three, but I don't know how likely that is to happen because to do so he'd have to displace Steph or Harden as an all-star team starter which doesn't seem likely since they're like top 5 players and Mitchell still is on the outside looking into the top 20 atm.",06-19-2019,1560984418.0

Portland - Scary as he'll and just proved they can win multiple playoff series.

Denver - Young and now playoff bloodied.

Dallas - Young, but possibly quickly re-tooling around Luka

OKC - Russ and PG13 plus Roberson coming back is gonna help their D.

Houston - Harden is still Harden and CP3 can orchestrate a fantastic offense.  Plus D'Antoni is fantastic.

Sacramento - Young and upcoming and clearly hungry.

utahjazz,hell,"Here's where I'd rank that Big 3 next season, including injuries, age, etc...

1) Lakers: LeBron, AD, and Kuzma

The possible GOAT, plus a top 10 player, plus a near All-Star

2) Raptors: Kawhi, Lowry, and Siakam

NBA Champs, nuff said

3) 76ers: Embiid, Butler, and Simmons

Embiid is slightly better than Gobert, Butler is better than Mitchell or Connelly, and Simmons is slightly below Mitchell.

4) Jazz: Mitchell, Conley, Gobert

Gobert is the DPOY, and leads the league in all kinds of advanced stats, offensively and defensively. Connelly is All-NBA caliber on offense and defense. Mitchell has only played two season and has already broken all kinds of records that put him in elite company. Look for him to make another jump forward this year.

5) Bucks: Giannis, Middleton, and Brogdon

Solid, but as a whole, Mitchell, Connelly and Gobert are better than the Bucks big three as their strength lies in the MVP caliber play of Giannis.

6) Rockets: Harden, CP3, and Capela

Dysfunctional, CP3 is old AF, and this big 3 is likely to be split up because CP3 annoys his teammates as much as he does the fans of every other NBA team.

7) Blazers: Dame, McCollum, and Nurkic

They beat the Nuggets in the playoffs so I'd rank them above them.

8) Nuggets: Jokic, Murray, and Millsap

Millsap is washed. So really this is just Jokic and Murray.

9) Thunder: Westbrook, PG, and Adams

Westbrook is horribly inefficient and really brings this big three down in the rankings. Also, Steven Adams is likely gone.

10) Warriors: KD, Curry, and Klay

Injured, so really just Curry",06-20-2019,1561060728.0

Denver, the 2 seed, and Por, the 3, do not project to make any significant moves compared to Conley. They will have to rely on internal development. Oh wait, jazz have that too and Mitchell is more likely to take a leap then anyone on those teams.

utahjazz,hell,"I'll see if I can give a quick rundown.

After a short period in the dumpster that we call the ***Corbin Dark Age***, the Jazz have made the playoffs the last three seasons and won two 1st round playoff series (Clippers in 2017, Thunder in 2018), losing to the Warriors in 2017 and the Rockets the last two years. 

After the 2017 season, our ""star"" player (one Gorgonzola Hamberder) ditched us for the amazing Boston Celtics and many folks had us left for dead. 

Luckily for us, our front office stole Spida at #13 because at least 12 other front offices are completely braindead (Tatum is at least good, can't say much for anyone else) and Denver is nice enough to keep giving us players better than the ones on their roster. We made the playoffs in '18, won a series, and got bounced by the 65 win Rockets pretty handily. Not bad for a team that just lost their only All-Star.

We ran it back this season with pretty much the same roster and got bounced by the Rockets yet again. Our FO knew we had to make some changes and traded with Memphis for their PG, Mike Conley Jr.

Current Roster

Starting PG - ***Mike Conley Jr.***: Acquired from Memphis in exchange for Kyle Korver, Jae Crowder, Grayson Allen, the 24th pick in the 2019 Draft, and a future 1st round pick, the 31 year old Conley is coming off a career season of 21.4/3.4/6.4 despite Memphis struggling. He provides an additional scoring and playmaking threat and is a huge upgrade over the non-shooting, turnover prone Ricky Rubio.

Starting SG - ***Donovan Mitchell***: Started poorly last season but averaged 26.5/4.5/4.8 in the second half to wrap up a pretty good sophomore campaign. He'll have a full offseason to work out this year (was injured the previous offseason), and with Conley replacing Rubio he should easily hit those averages across the whole season. This guy is the real deal, and way better than Jamal Murray.

Starting SF - ***Joe Ingles***: A 3pt sniper and very good secondary playmaker, Joe is also the best NBA meme. His 3pt% dropped last year and he was gassed towards the end due to increased usage and having to run the offense more since all of our PGs got hurt. Conley will have a big impact here as Joe won't be relied upon as much for playmaking/PnR, especially in the 2nd unit - one of Donovan/Mike will always be out there.

Starting PF - ***????***: We don't know who this is yet. It's likely Derrick Favors, longtime Jazzman, but the Jazz have until July 6th to guarantee his contract. A lot of folks here want a stretch 4 in this slot. Favors is a decent 4 and an amazing backup 5 though.

Starting C - ***Rudy Gobert***: Two-time, reigning Defensive Player of the Year, set the NBA record for dunks in a season last year. The Jazz have been a top-3 NBA defense in each of the last 3 seasons and Rudy is why. He's also the best screening big in the NBA, having lead the league in screen-assists and points generated from screens the last two seasons. He's also an elite PnR big and rim-runner. 

He's one of the three best centers in the league. He's carried the Jazz to the playoffs for three straight seasons in the Western Conference with Gobarth Hawgshorts and a (admittedly incredible) rookie/sophmore as his second best teammate, a feat that AD and KAT could only dream of. He eats Jokic for breakfast. The only thing he fears is Harden/Capela PnR because Harden is stupid and we hates him, precious.

***THE BENCH***

SG/SF ***Royce O'Neale***: He's good. Could be REALLY good. Great defensively, shoots 38% from 3. Probably our 6th man.

PG ***Dante Exum***: He is terminally injured. When he's not, he's very fast and elite defensively. Can't shoot though.

SF/PF ***Georges Niang***: End of the bench guy last two seasons but played himself into the rotation at the end of last year. Great shooter, decent handles for a slow white SF, not a great defender but tries hard.

***2nd round picks***: I know nothing about these guys. Hopefully they're good, but most 2nd rounders don't make the league.

***Next Season***

The Jazz still have to replace some of the production they lost in the Conley trade (specifically Jae Crowder) but if they can pick up some decent pieces, including a stretch 4, they project to be a top-3 team in the Western Conference. Conley is a significant upgrade at the PG slot. Fans should be very excited for the Jazz's prospects coming up here.",06-26-2019,1561587848.0
utahjazz,hell,"Joe Ingles is arguably the best trash talker in the NBA and he looks like an average Joe (pun intended)

You know about Mitchell. Just watch anything with him to fall in love some more.

utahjazz,hell,"Not a fan of the Jazz, but I do like 2 of their players. One being Mitchell like you said, he‚Äôs entering his 3rd year this upcoming season and is one of the promising young stars. The other i like is Mike Conley, who the Jazz just traded for. Conley was on one of my teams the Grizzlies and I can see he‚Äôs a great fit in Utah. Not only is he a great teammate and has great sportsmanship, but he‚Äôs a great underrated player as well. He has no all star appearances, but if he plays in the eastern conference his whole career(grizz are in the west) he would be a 5x all star at least. He‚Äôs a team player that knows how to facilitate and play defense, and he can score. 

Other than that, the Jazz have Rudy Gobert, back to back defensive player of the year. Dereck Favors is good too, he‚Äôs a nice defensive player and rebounder. Joe Ingles doesn‚Äôt look like he plays basketball but he can shoot and pass. Royce O‚ÄôNeal is nice off the bench I like him. 

Jazz have been in the playoffs the past few years and are improving so they‚Äôre a nice team to follow. Other teams I suggest are the Nuggets, Clippers, Kings(!), Hawks, Nets, Celtics, all teams that are young but are improving and are all in playoff contention for next year. The Pelicans and Mavs have a lot of young talent too so those teams can be nice to watch as well.",06-26-2019,1561585031.0

We have Joe Ingles and the jingled meme's that come with him as well as the amazing playmaking ability and 3-point shooting he brings to the table. Honestly, as someone who has been a Jazz fan since the 80s, this is the most excited I've been about the Jazz since the Stockton/Malone finals era. From top to bottom we have a solid organization and it looks like we finally have the right pieces in place to get that championship, and that's what I'm looking forward to next year. How will Donovan improve now that there will be spacing on the floor with Conley? Can Exum *finally* come back from injury and be successful?

He can play PF if really needed (Utah really tried to make the twin towers work), but in today's NBA, it will be better if he plays center. That said, he's a damn good center. He has nice post moves, is tenacious on the offensive and defensive glass, and plays with ferocity.

I'm fairly confident he can play 30 minutes a night. Our roster composition was the main thing holding him back from playing more minutes, since we were trying to develop Gobert more and since a big part of the defensive strategy centered around Gobert.

With the Lakers, I think people underestimate how bad minimum-contract players are.  In any stretch of time where Lebron/AD/Kawhi aren't all on the court together, there's going to be multiple guys you can leave alone on offense and/or target on defense.

i think mostly conley, mitchell, and gobert are locked in as starters and finishers 100% of the time

im closing to putting bojan in this group because this guy is a fucking baller. im not sure how familiar you guys are with bojan, but theres an argument to be made that he is better than donovan right now. hes got legit talent and size and bbiq",07-04-2019,1562270335.0

utahjazz,shit,"Damn they are looking good. Though 2 things I notice:

Lack of playmaking: Kawhi and PG aren't great passers. They pass out of double teams but they rarely run the PnR. Of course, you could argue they don't need to pass because they're so efficient in isolation but lack of playmaking will make them use more energy on offense in the 82 game season. Addressing this issue is probably getting Rondo on the minimum. When Rondo actually gives a shit and is motivated he's an entirely different player. There's the Doc Rivers connection as well.


Lack of a legit big man: Zubac is a good young player, but he's got some stone hands and not sure he can keep up for even 20 minutes a game. Next up is Montrezl, but the dude is the same height as Paul George at 6'9. He has an insane motor that's Draymond-like but he's gonna be battling the boards against the likes of Gobert, AD, Whiteside, Nurkic, Jokic, Capela, Adams in the west and Embiid/Giannis in the east. That just spells foul trouble to me. I'm thinking they sign Dwight on the minimum as well. I don't see him going back to the Lakers and looking Kobe in the eye.

They can schedule the Lakers and Clippers AND concerts in the same venue without giving them absurd amount of back to backs, but Utah limiting a single day of the week which amounts to 23 days that are off limits over the course of an NBA season is some how this cataclysmic obstacle that can't be overcome.

I get people love hating on religion, but the No Sunday Home Game is a myth that people just want to believe to further back up their own biases. Even with *only* 6 days open that's 135 days to schedule 41 Jazz games and not have an insane front loaded schedule.

No Sunday Home Games doesn't equate for them giving us extended road trips with only a single game back home then another road trip.

Even our away Sunday games was a total of **6** on the season.

Utah plays a ton of Mon-Wed-Fri even on our road trips, so if it's a Sunday issue why aren't we playing a bunch of Sunday road games?

utahjazz,hell," 

One pair of size 19 shoes.

At time of publication, that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs left on [Adidas‚Äô website](https://www.adidas.com/us/d.o.n.-issue-1-shoes/EF2400.html) of Donovan Mitchell‚Äôs first signature shoe, the D.O.N. Issue #1. Every other size has been sold out for days, since Mitchell‚Äôs shoe first went up for sale a week ago. Adidas hasn‚Äôt released sales numbers, and more colors are coming later in the month, but it‚Äôs fair to say that demand has outweighed supply.

Come to think of it, that point might stand for Mitchell himself.

Since the Jazz exited the playoffs, Mitchell has spent most of his time in his home state of New York, working with NBA trainer Chris Brickley on his game. But over the last two weeks, Mitchell‚Äôs been on a more domestic tour, walking the world in his own size 17 shoe.

First, he went to Los Angeles, releasing a commercial for and attending the premiere of the new Spiderman movie his shoes are affiliated with. While there, he worked out multiple times with new teammate Mike Conley. Then, he headed to Salt Lake City, to watch teammates in the Salt Lake City Summer League and get some time in the Jazz‚Äôs Zions Bank Basketball Facility. From there, it was to Las Vegas, where Mitchell watched friends in NBA summer league action and even experienced an earthquake.

&#x200B;

After his [world travels of a year ago](https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2018/07/30/after-worldwide-tour-jazz/), when Mitchell went to Greece, Spain, the Philippines, and China, he‚Äôs slated this week to go to France, Germany, and Asia as part of a worldwide shoe tour.

There is an irony, though, that he‚Äôs slated to go on this international tour just as he‚Äôs made some of his most pointed comments about why he feels Utah is a good fit for his home. On this week‚Äôs [LightHarted podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lightharted-podcast-with-josh-hart/id1469286394#episodeGuid=6abd04ba-9d77-11e9-b3f5-f35ea5c664db) ‚Äî hosted by New Orleans Pelican Josh Hart ‚Äî Mitchell spoke at length about why he wants to stay in Utah while other free agents chase bigger markets.

*‚Äú*Being in Utah, they allow me to be me. They allow me to be the kid that I am. Like, if I‚Äôm out to eat, you know, they‚Äôll say ‚Äònice to meet you‚Äô and leave you alone,"" Mitchell said. ‚ÄúIt reminded me of Louisville. ... I love it. I love everything about being in Utah. I‚Äôll never change it. I don‚Äôt need the big market to be happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI grew up around New York. I grew up around the big media. I grew up around all that stuff. And I don‚Äôt need that,‚Äù Mitchell said. ‚ÄúI need to focus on my game*.""*

Mitchell also brought up the success of Damian Lillard ‚Äî ""Look at what he‚Äôs turned Portland into, and look at what he‚Äôs turned himself into. ‚Ä¶ He hasn‚Äôt stepped outside of that‚Äù ‚Äî and John Stockton and Karl Malone ‚Äî ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to leave to be something big‚Äù ‚Äî while staying in the smaller communities they‚Äôve played in.

&#x200B;

Living in Utah, Mitchell says, doesn‚Äôt mean that someone can‚Äôt still have fun, that they can‚Äôt be part of the national conversation, that they can‚Äôt have massive commercial success, and he wants to prove that. That, too, goes hand in hand with success on the court: The better the player, the more successful his business will be.

‚ÄúYou can have a shoe, and be confident, content, and cool with that. Or you can have a shoe and ‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs only three guys who have 12 pairs of shoes, making retro. That‚Äôs the goal, to get to 12,"" Mitchell said. ‚ÄúSo, now I‚Äôve got to do it. I have a lot more work to do on the court*.‚Äù*

One stone on that path: an Olympic appearance for Team USA. Mitchell was named to the 20-man Team USA roster in June, and in August, he‚Äôll return to Las Vegas to train with the team. If he‚Äôs selected among the 12 players to go to the FIBA World Cup in China this September, it would put him in pole position to return to the team next summer in Tokyo.

‚ÄúThe thing that we‚Äôre looking for is defense, and he has the ability to be a real factor,‚Äù Jerry Colangelo [said then](https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2019/06/10/donovan-mitchell-selected/) of Mitchell. ""That could be the best way for him to make a roster spot, is to play incredible defense.‚Äù

Come October‚Äôs training camp, Mitchell will again be asked to reach new heights, this time for a team that seems to have real chances at surviving a very competitive Western Conference. And he‚Äôll do so from his adopted home in Utah, overseeing a burgeoning business as a celebrity while still being able to find a sense of normalcy.

Near the end of the podcast, Mitchell tells Hart a story. ""At the end of the day, we walk off the court and I can go sit on my own. I sat next to a family before we played OKC last year, it‚Äôs called Ensign Peak. I just sat up there on a mountaintop, sat next to a family, and was just talking to them. Nothing wild, nothing crazy. It was just cool to be able to be that normal.‚Äù

utahjazz,hell,"**LONG POST.. but this should cover the question fully**

The last couple of seasons the Jazz have had the 5th seed in the playoffs led by Gobert, Mitchell, depth and a top 3 defense. 

Most of our critics believed that while we were a good team, we still weren‚Äôt at the level to compete or beat teams with star rosters like GSW, HOU, etc.. come playoff time due to the lack of playmakers and offensive capacity. This was evident in the both losses the last 2 years to Houston, where they focused on bottling up Mitchell & Ingles defensively, while leaving Rubio more open. The other problem was offensively, Favors never could stretch the floor for the Jazz, which further limited the offense.

The Jazz went into the offseason realizing their struggles, knowing that if they wanted to contend in the West with the best teams, they needed to improve their roster with playmakers who can stretch the floor. 

So the Jazz quickly made the move to trade for Mike Conley, without giving up the core of Mitchell, Gobert, and Ingles. Adding Conley takes the pressure off of Mitchell, and brings more floor spacing, and one of the most underrated guards in the league. As a Spurs fan, I‚Äôm sure you know all about how good he his. 

Then right as FA opens, they go out and get Bojan B. He is very underrated imo. He spaces the floor even more for the Jazz. Career 40% 3 point shooter, has a bunch offensive tools, and is a solid defender. After Oladipo got injured, he averaged around 20 a game for the Pacers last season, as the main option.

Then the Jazz agree to deals with Ed Davis, Jeff Green. These players will fill voids left by Crowder, Favors. Both are great veteran role players, who both wanted to come to Utah, a place that has never been a FA destination. Until now I guess. 

They added Muddiay, who both sides believe that Utah/Conley‚Äôs mentorship can help become a better player. He‚Äôs a young, tall combo guard. May not see a lot of time next season unless Exum gets hurt, but okay insurance/depth. 

Almost all of the players that the Jazz added are great locker room guys, who fit the mold of the Jazz identity.

So the national media is #takingnote, of these additions to our team. Because on paper, the Jazz significantly improved in the areas previously mentioned, while keeping their core players (Mitchell/Gobert still improving), a top 5 defensive identity, and have a deep roster.

There are still skeptics, but Mitchell and Conley should both have improved games playing with one another and most believe Mitchell needs to take that all star step to allow this team to fully realize the potential it has. 

Now it‚Äôs up to our coach and players to bond with one another, keep improving and form the team that on paper, has every right to be called a title contender.",07-10-2019,1562781864.0
utahjazz,hell,"Well we're obviously MUCH improved. Just on a roster standpoint, we had 3 starters who were bad shooters in Rubio, Favors, and Gobert. Gobert and Favors are very efficient offensive players, but they don't help spacing, and together they fit really bad offensively, though defensively they are incredible together, well atleast at defending the paint. Rubio came to work every day, but honestly was just a bad fit, Conley is a good shooter and scores much more as well, his playmaking ability I don't think are far removed, and his defense is probably a similar level if not higher. Bojan is a much better shooter than Favors, and was able to score over 20ppg when Oladipo went out. Bojan is also one of the best defenders against Lebron, so while people may question his size for PF, I feel like he can match up well with many PF's. Green adds another stretch 4 who can shoot. Ed Davis is one of the best rebounders in the league, so he will be a real solid backup to Gobert. Exum is back, if he can give us more games than last year, that's always a plus. Mudiay is still young, and was able to score around 20ppg PER36 with decent efficiency, and he's here for all the right reasons, to work with our player development team. Last but not least, Mitchell started the year really bad, taking poor shots, and without his explosiveness, I think it was mostly mental, but could have been partially because of an injury as well, so his stats don't really tell the entire story. Mitchell really played like a superstar in the 2019 calendar year, just go look at his splits. Honestly of the guys we lost, we will miss Crowder's toughness to some extent, and Korver's shooting, but I think we've more than replaced them. Favor's defense will be missed, but I do think our perimeter defense is better, and we're far more balanced as a team thanks to our vast improvements offensively.",07-11-2019,1562855445.0
utahjazz,hell,"""Utah needs a star"". Am I crazy to think Mitchell is close to being a star player?

utahjazz,hell,"I could care less for the rebounding and more assists I would potentially get from Westbrook, in the end of the day, most of the additional rebounds Westbrook gets is due to how he jumping around like a rabbit trying to grab every board, this kind of positioning tends to mean you're not focusing on your defensive assignment, and you're stealing a lot of the boards from your teammates. In other words, out of those 10rpg, sure 3-4 of them would of gone to his teammates had he not had them, at best maybe 1 of them would of gone to the opposing team.  Assists, I guess he got a ton of them because he becomes passive trying to get to 10 assists, but I'll give him some credit here, it's still very difficult to achieve. I think Conley is definitely a better defender though and he's clearly a much better shooter. Last year they were basically identical in ppg (per minute), but Conley was FAR more efficient. I like Conley's attitude WAY more, you're not going to see his complaining constantly to refs, and caring about his personal stats, he's an actual leader. If your team SUCKS, perhaps Westbrook can get you more wins, because yes individually he's more skilled, no doubt about it, but Conley in a good system works way better IMO. Adding picks and Exum is insult to injury. No thanks.  
  
The Mitchell suggestion is RIDICULOUS. Mitchell's 2nd half of the season was easily better than Westbrook was. Mitchell has 1-2 more cheap seasons, and when he resigns he still will be far cheaper, and by that point a MUCH better player than Westbrook. Lets just pretend we are interested in doing the trade, what kind of fit would Conley and Westbrook be? Westbrook is a bad shooter, are you planning on delegating him to SG, plus you reduce him a threat having him off the ball since he's not a catch and shoot player. Conley would be a much better SG than Westbrook, but we would be diminishing Conley's playmaking opportunities, and taking away his opportunities to drive to the hoop, especially since Westbrook's usage is really high. Not to mention, what it would take to match the salaries, Mitchell is making like $34M less, without adding Gobert or Conley we have to add like 5 players to match the salaries.

2. The fans were waiting for Tracy Mcgrady, not Mitchell himself.

utahjazz,fuck,"Man, this is frustrating. I think both sides have some merit, but more than anything it's getting blown way out of proportion. Yes, Donovan was a bit insensitive and thoughtless. As an ambassador on a promotional tour he should know better than to be calling out fans like that, even if it wasn't mean spirited. I think it was a bit out of frustration and he could've handled it better or at the very least not publically posted it.  On the other hand Chinese fans are making this way bigger than it needs to be. His video isn't explicitly hating on them, he definitely seems more amused than anything else, and if this is all it takes to be hated then they need to step the fuck back and revaluate their prioriries. Donovan is definitely more gracious to fans than the majority of the NBA, hating on him for his fan interaction is barking up the wrong tree. 

It's a shame that Donovans rep will take a hit, but he's a good guy and I think if he keeps at it people will see past this, or at least I hope they will.

utahjazz,hell,"Determining where to send the second round picks is certainly an interesting choice, in my opinion. Brantley came out on fire in the SLC league, looked reasonably competent running point forward, and played super hard. However, I could see our roster not really needing any more floor generals and I think Brantley's value drops a little if we're not asking him to do that. (Considering we already have Conley, Mitchell, Jingles, Exum/Mudiay as handlers)

Oni just slots right into lineups better than the other two picks. He's got good length, can keep up on defense, and doesn't need the ball much to be valuable on offense. He was asked to do a lot on the Yale team, but a smaller role like this (sitting in the corner and waiting for a kick-out) suits his skill set more than either Brantley's or JWF's, who both will have plenty of time for ball control in the G-league. That said, we need to see Oni hit 3's at a nice 35%+ clip and be able to give the premier wings in the league problems on defense (kind of like a Royce O'Neale -esque role) before declaring him a valuable bench member.",07-17-2019,1563399722.0

utahjazz,hell,"He did awful because he was the only scoring threat on the team. The Rockets‚Äô switching defense has historically given the Jazz‚Äôs motion offense fits. 

The idea behind the motion offense is to create opportunities for our guys to score. Gobert screens so much that, eventually, someone will have an advantageous match-up or an open shot. This depends heavily on those screens - Gobert forces the defense to make choices, and defenses make mistakes when they have to make those choices. 

Houston‚Äôs defense is designed to prevent having to make choices. Just switch. No thinking, no what-ifs - switch everything. Gobert screens for Donovan, and Capela switches onto Donovan instantly. Whoever was guarding Donovan (Tucker, lost likely) also immediately picks up Rudy. No advantage gained here beyond a mismatch of Capela guarding Mitchell. (Side note here: Capela is one of the best bigs at guarding perimeter players. It‚Äôs his thing.)

Because the defense prevents any gained advantage, Donovan is then forced to find a shot on his own, then; either for him or a teammate. And as the Jazz bricked 3 after 3, Houston started sagging more and more into the paint to help on those Donovan drives.

utahjazz,fuck,">Switchability in your 4/5 position really is everything.

We just watched the Raptors prove that to be false with Marc Gasol.

>All these guys will completely take advantage of Gobert's lack of switching in a playoff series.

I think Gobert's been much better defending perimeter players since the 2017 playoffs where he got clowned by Steph.  He was great against Westbrook in 2018 and great against Harden this past year.  No big guy is ever going to be the ideal matchup against a smaller player; that's the whole reason for screening.  But I'll take Gobert defending the wing over at least 27 of the league's starting centers.  And, let's not forget how Capela was demolished in the playoffs this past year by Steph, and Capela's lauded as one of the best at defending perimeter players among centers - if this person wants to say that Gobert is the reason the Jazz won't win, then how do they feel about Capela?

>The defense that Utah tried on Houston worked last year *only* because Harden refuses to shoot the midrange jumper.  That 20 footer was literally wide open for him every possession, and every other guard would have no qualms just taking it over and over.

This is a really, *really* dumb attempt to justify their opinion.  Utah doesn't run that defense against any other team - so why even bring this up?  The fact that they were able to get a defensive scheme that unorthodox set up (and working really well, holding Houston to an average of 100 points per game in G3-5) in less than 3 games should be lauded!  The coaching staff was able to customize an entire defensive scheme for a playoff opponent, the players were smart and capable enough to execute it, the team stuck with it despite the 2 early losses when it would have been easy to give up, and it ended up fucking working!

Utah changes its defensive strategy based on the opponent.  A team that *never* switches on defense suddenly started switching against Houston in both of the last 2 offseasons.  They did not switch against OKC in R1 last year.  So the scheme is fluid, meaning that the defense will be geared against whatever the other team is good at.  

Finally, the only reason that the Jazz ran that ""doggy-syle"" defense is because Harden is fucking ridiculous at the step-back 3.  What other player in the league has that in their arsenal - Luka Doncic?  Is that it?  The Jazz won't give up the midrange like that against any other player because they won't be as scared of a player shooting the shots that Harden shoots.

Clippers have Jamychal Green but he's not big enough to stop Gobert, Jokic or even LA. Team defense and help side coverage will be the key and my main concern since Crowder and Favors were elite at it. It's my only concern about Bogdanovic. 

On offensive, we will be pretty unstoppable with Conley and Mitchell at the point of attack with the vertical spacing of Gobert and the 3pt spacing from Bogdanovic and Ingles or O'Neale. Only the Clippers and Nuggets have the defenders to combat it, and the Nuggets would have to keep Murray off the floor to do that.",07-29-2019,1564418800.0

utahjazz,hell,"I think our best matchup would be the Nuggets.  Gobert just clowned on Jokic every time we played them last year.  My gut instinct is to say that I'm worried about the Clippers, but honestly, I think we could take them in a series.  We have 2 really great defenders at the forward spots in O'neale and Ingles.  Considering how well O'neale did against Harden in our series I would feel very confident in putting him on Kawhi.  Obviously Ingles is Paul George's dad and I could see us actually slowing down their front court a lot.  Unless the Clips trade for a better center (with assets that don't exist because they gave away pretty much everything for PG) Gobert will just dominate Zubac/Harrol in the PnR.  Conley is much better than lou williams and the Clips would probably end up putting either beverly or kawhi on Mitchell.  

&#x200B;

Against everyone else I really have no idea.  I feel like the warriors are going to be sleepers next season when Klay get's back and they will probably trade D'lo for something and make a midseason improvment along the way.  All in all though, I really don't think that there is a team in the west that can effectively guard us.  We have the best coach in the league, a top 5 backcourt duo in the league, a top 3 center in the league, and enough shooters to always have space on the floor.  

&#x200B;

As for the Rockets I have the upmost confidence that we'd beat them in 5 or 6.  Our defense against them worked wonders in games 3-5 and we were a couple of open threes away from pushing that series to a game six.  Like, if we had just shot 30% on wide open 3's we would have won games 3 and 5 and been up 3-2 lol.  Now we won't have the same problems and O'neale is still there to shut down harden.

We were fortunate to get on him pretty early. He was one of those kids who blew up that summer and made a big name for himself in a short period of time.

**Balado:**¬†It didn‚Äôt matter where he ranked or anything like that, we just knew the way he played and the type of kid he was ‚Äî he was the right guy for Louisville and Coach P because of our system. Coach loved him right away.

**Lee:**¬†He got blown by¬†‚Äî¬†it was a big man on Puerto Rico‚Äôs junior team¬†‚Äî¬†and Coach P was reaming into him, letting him have it, saying he was too slow.

**Logan Baumann, assistant video coordinator:**¬†We‚Äôre staying at the Ritz-Carlton in San Juan, eating a pregame meal. Donovan goes up to get a second plate of pasta. He gets a considerable portion, like a mountain of pasta ‚Äî fettuccine alfredo, I think it was. Coach P is eyeing everybody and sees him, and he says, ‚ÄúDonovan, how many times have you been up there?‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúThis is my second time,‚Äù and he smiles. I‚Äôm sitting on the other side of the table thinking this is not going to turn out well, like, no, no, no! You knew what Coach was going to come with. Coach asks (Ray Ganong, the strength and conditioning coach), ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Donovan‚Äôs weight?‚Äù It was around 220 or something like that. He says, ‚ÄúDonovan is that much?!‚Äù At this point, he has the attention of the entire room.

**Lee:**¬†He says, ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs unacceptable. The kid‚Äôs fat. He needs to get to 205.‚Äù

**Adel:**¬†Ever since then, he was always nervous to go for seconds.

**Pitino, a year later:**¬†I couldn‚Äôt figure out why he was getting beaten so much defensively, even though he was a low body-fat guy. I just felt (220) pounds for a 2-guard was way too heavy.

*Mitchell‚Äôs appetite and love of food, topics about which he owned up to publicly, became the stuff of legend among his teammates.*

**Lee:**¬†We could put some meals down. At Griff‚Äôs (a sports bar owned by former U of L star Darrell Griffith), we got the pasta with the chicken, and we‚Äôd get a double order of chicken, Texas toast and another side. We‚Äôd get chicken and waffles, the sweet potato fries. We‚Äôd get double orders at Mt. Fuji. I mean it was on some Joey Chestnut levels. The man can eat.

**Adel:**¬†He really liked Mt. Fuji. He‚Äôd get hibachi with extra rice, extra shrimp and chicken and then something on the side.

**Matt Melander, student manager:**¬†He had a birthday while he was at school, and his mom sent a cake to the mini-Yum Center (the on-campus practice facility). Everybody was getting pieces of cake, and Coach P was in the lobby. Donovan was about to grab a piece, and Coach P gives him a look, like, I don‚Äôt know if you should eat that. So Donovan comes over to me a minute later and whispers, ‚ÄúHey, Matt, can you bring a piece back to the room for me?‚Äù

**Lewis:**¬†That happened frequently throughout the year. He would sneak a whole bunch of second plates. He‚Äôd ask us to keep it on the hush for him. He was notorious. He put me on those missions a few times too.

**Adel:**¬†He‚Äôd also ask real quietly, ‚ÄúCan you go grab a plate for me?‚Äù

**Lewis:**¬†I have an aunt who lives in Louisville. She made home-cooked meals and would have me over a lot. One day she made enough for other guys, so I took Donovan and a few others over with me. We had pork chops. Don ate so many pork chops. I mean¬†*so*¬†many pork chops. He kept asking for more and more. To this day, my aunt still calls him ‚ÄúPork Chop.‚Äù

utahjazz,hell,"On Pitino pulling him from the starting lineup in his sophomore year: 

*Before his sophomore year, Mitchell started popping up in mock drafts, but he struggled with his shooting in the early weeks of the season. Padgett says the staff saw promising plays, but he played just OK in a 73-70 win over Kentucky and struggled in a loss against Virginia. So three days later, in a rivalry showdown with Indiana on New Year‚Äôs Eve, Pitino pulled Mitchell from the starting lineup.*  


**Pitino (after the IU game):**¬†I like to change things when you lose, get people out of their comfort zone. I said, ‚ÄúLook, son, I never thought I‚Äôd take you out of the starting lineup, but I need a star who wants to play like a star.‚Äù That means he‚Äôs not counting his misses. He‚Äôs someone who shoots every open shot, creates and doesn‚Äôt worry about what the outside world thinks of his game. I said, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre a star, but you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a star.‚Äù  


**Baumann:**¬†One thing that makes (Pitino) great is how he coaches his star players. He was hard on them. He didn‚Äôt give them any leeway. The great ones are the ones who can take it and move on and use it. Donovan was like that. He‚Äôd take it and try to get better.  


**Adel:**¬†When we rode up to Indianapolis on the bus, I was like, Man, don‚Äôt worry about not starting. Be aggressive. Be yourself. And he just had a look. I just thought, He is ready to go.  


**McMahon:**¬†I was stressed about that game. They had Thomas Bryant and O.G. Anunoby. They had guards who could take the game over. But that was a turning point in our season. We started to look to Donovan as our go-to guy.  


*Mitchell scored what was then a career-high 25 points in 77-62 victory.*  


**Adel:**¬†As soon as he got in the game, he took it over. He was making pro shots. From there he took off.  


**Padgett:**¬†It reminded me of when Terry Rozier was a sophomore and we went to Western Kentucky. Montrezl Harrell gets thrown out of the game because of a scuffle. We go into halftime up five or six, and Terry comes out of the gates and scores something like 17 straight and we win. That IU game was the same thing for Donovan.

**Lewis:**¬†He was really hurt. I tried to console him and tell him he‚Äôd learn from it, and he knew all that, but it was a different level of expectation he had for himself.

I always thought Coach P was one of the best evaluators around, and he‚Äôd say if Donovan could shoot a little better and more consistently and learn to play with the ball in his hands, he‚Äôd be great. Both things he did.
Padgett:¬†When we got him, did we see what he was going to become at that time? No. I don‚Äôt think anyone did. But we also saw he had potential to be a great player, and he wanted to get better.
Pitino (in 2014):¬†He‚Äôs physically able to play any 2-guard in America, and he‚Äôs athletic enough. He‚Äôs very graceful. He‚Äôs a highlight film.
The rest of the 2015 signing class included high school prospects Deng Adel, a wing; Ryan McMahon, a guard; and forward Ray Spalding. Graduate transfer guards Damion Lee (Drexel) and Trey Lewis (Cleveland State) also came on board. Mitchell made an impression in his initial interactions with his teammates. Pitino joked at the time that Mitchell ‚Äúacts like a 35-year-old‚Äù because he was so courteous and polished for a teenager.¬†
Lee:¬†He had a little-ass head on a big body. He didn‚Äôt have the hair he has now. You could tell he was crazy athletic, but he was still so young.
Adel:¬†The first thing I noticed were his shoes. Like, Damn, you‚Äôve got big-ass feet. (Mitchell reportedly wears a size 17.) But he was really outgoing and couldn‚Äôt wait to get there and get to work. (At the Kentucky Derby Festival Classic, a spring high school all-star game), he kept throwing the ball off the wall and dunking it. That was like, Man, this guy has bounce.
McMahon:¬†Before I met him, I saw the video that went viral of him making the 3-pointer, catching it out of the net before it landed and windmilling it. That was just absurd. When I saw him do it in person, I was like, OK, this kid is something else. Like, Dude, you‚Äôre a freak.
¬†
Louisville was coming off a run to the Elite Eight in 2015, and stars Wayne Blackshear, Montrezl Harrell and Terry Rozier were gone. Lee and Lewis, who had committed that spring, were expected to be the go-to guys before handing the keys to the program to Adel, Mitchell, Spalding and the other young prospects.¬†
Lee:¬†After I committed, he was one of the first people to text me, and he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to learning so much from you.‚Äù When I first got there, he texted me, ‚ÄúDid you land safe?‚Äù I said yeah. He said, ‚ÄúOK, we‚Äôve got business to attend to. Let‚Äôs go to the gym tonight.‚Äù I was already going to go to the gym, but you don‚Äôt see that type of eagerness and that desire to be better from guys coming in for their freshman year too much.
Lewis¬†I was still at Cleveland State, getting ready to graduate, when I got this random FaceTime call. It was Donovan. He was finishing school at Brewster, and he asked me about college and what to expect. He wanted to know what to bring to school. He said he couldn‚Äôt wait to meet me. He was asking me all these questions. I would‚Äôve never called someone like that when I was in high school.
Padgett:¬†That was the summer Coach Pitino was involved with the Puerto Rican national team. He was pretty tied up. (Assistant coach) Ralph Willard was running all the workouts in Louisville. You could see the athletic ability with Donovan, but he wasn‚Äôt anything even remotely close to what he is now. His jump shot was flat. He didn‚Äôt have great mechanics. Ralph got him on the shooting gun and started working with him on his arc right away.
Michael Bowden, video coordinator:¬†At the time, Steph Curry was all the rage. Coach (Pitino) got really obsessed with arc on shots. We‚Äôd set up cameras and see the highest point and if it‚Äôs consistent. We also had a machine to measure arc. Showing him the video and having Steph Curry film as an example was a good way to look at it for Donovan.
Balado:¬†We did training camp in Louisville before we went down for a week to play in Puerto Rico against the national and junior teams. Coach Pitino and I were in Puerto Rico for a few weeks before the training camp, and when we came back, Donovan‚Äôs shot was so much better. It was more consistent with arc. It didn‚Äôt look different every rep. We did two-a-days with the Louisville kids to get ready for the trip, and then we‚Äôd practice the Puerto Rican team in between. Donovan would come back again after the second practice and shoot.
Bowden:¬†Donovan‚Äôs shot arc was in the low 30s (degrees) when we started. He raised it 8 or 9 degrees over those few months. He liked working on it. He took pride in it.
On one of the first nights in Puerto Rico, Louisville‚Äôs ‚Äúreserve‚Äù team lost, 79-77, to the Puerto Rican junior team. Mitchell fumbled away the ball in the final possession, never getting a shot off.
Adel:¬†We went back to the locker room and he was crying. I was like, Look, this is the first time you‚Äôve ever played against this level of competition. But he was so competitive. That‚Äôs how bad he wanted to win.
Lewis:¬†He was really hurt. I tried to console him and tell him he‚Äôd learn from it, and he knew all that, but it was a different level of expectation he had for himself. He felt like he had let his teammates and his coaches down. He still has that mentality. He hates letting his team down. I was like, Man, this kid is crying from a preseason game. That showed his passion and love for this.
That week in Puerto Rico, Mitchell also got a first-hand glimpse of Pitino‚Äôs fitness expectations for his young guard.
Lee:¬†He got blown by¬†‚Äî¬†it was a big man on Puerto Rico‚Äôs junior team¬†‚Äî¬†and Coach P was reaming into him, letting him have it, saying he was too slow.
Logan Baumann, assistant video coordinator:¬†We‚Äôre staying at the Ritz-Carlton in San Juan, eating a pregame meal. Donovan goes up to get a second plate of pasta. He gets a considerable portion, like a mountain of pasta ‚Äî fettuccine alfredo, I think it was. Coach P is eyeing everybody and sees him, and he says, ‚ÄúDonovan, how many times have you been up there?‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúThis is my second time,‚Äù and he smiles. I‚Äôm sitting on the other side of the table thinking this is not going to turn out well, like, no, no, no! You knew what Coach was going to come with. Coach asks (Ray Ganong, the strength and conditioning coach), ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Donovan‚Äôs weight?‚Äù It was around 220 or something like that. He says, ‚ÄúDonovan is that much?!‚Äù At this point, he has the attention of the entire room.
Lee:¬†He says, ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs unacceptable. The kid‚Äôs fat. He needs to get to 205.‚Äù
Adel:¬†Ever since then, he was always nervous to go for seconds.
Pitino, a year later:¬†I couldn‚Äôt figure out why he was getting beaten so much defensively, even though he was a low body-fat guy. I just felt (220) pounds for a 2-guard was way too heavy.
Mitchell‚Äôs appetite and love of food, topics about which he owned up to publicly, became the stuff of legend among his teammates.
Lee:¬†We could put some meals down. At Griff‚Äôs (a sports bar owned by former U of L star Darrell Griffith), we got the pasta with the chicken, and we‚Äôd get a double order of chicken, Texas toast and another side. We‚Äôd get chicken and waffles, the sweet potato fries. We‚Äôd get double",08-01-2019,1564641915.0
utahjazz,hell,"¬†orders at Mt. Fuji. I mean it was on some Joey Chestnut levels. The man can eat.
Adel:¬†He really liked Mt. Fuji. He‚Äôd get hibachi with extra rice, extra shrimp and chicken and then something on the side.
Matt Melander, student manager:¬†He had a birthday while he was at school, and his mom sent a cake to the mini-Yum Center (the on-campus practice facility). Everybody was getting pieces of cake, and Coach P was in the lobby. Donovan was about to grab a piece, and Coach P gives him a look, like, I don‚Äôt know if you should eat that. So Donovan comes over to me a minute later and whispers, ‚ÄúHey, Matt, can you bring a piece back to the room for me?‚Äù
Lewis:¬†That happened frequently throughout the year. He would sneak a whole bunch of second plates. He‚Äôd ask us to keep it on the hush for him. He was notorious. He put me on those missions a few times too.
Adel:¬†He‚Äôd also ask real quietly, ‚ÄúCan you go grab a plate for me?‚Äù
Lewis:¬†I have an aunt who lives in Louisville. She made home-cooked meals and would have me over a lot. One day she made enough for other guys, so I took Donovan and a few others over with me. We had pork chops. Don ate so many pork chops. I mean¬†somany pork chops. He kept asking for more and more. To this day, my aunt still calls him ‚ÄúPork Chop.‚Äù
Bowden:¬†When he left to go through the (draft) combine, I cleaned out his dorm room. I‚Äôd never seen so many candy wrappers. He should be sponsored by the Haribo gummy bear company. There were probably 50 to 60 bags of them.
As his freshman season progressed, Mitchell showed signs of his potential at seemingly every turn.
Melander:¬†We‚Äôd play one-on-one defense against him ‚Äî the managers ‚Äî and he‚Äôd just kill us with fadeaways, turn-around jumpers, spin moves, everything. You always thought you had him and you didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm in front of him or I can contest his shot, then you‚Äôd turn around and the ball is in the hoop. It was just not fair.
Lee:¬†In practice, Donovan would be on the second team or the scout team. When you‚Äôre on the second team, you have more freedom than the guys on the first team. Donovan would be the other team‚Äôs best player. We‚Äôd call him ‚ÄúSliders,‚Äù because it was like when you play¬†NBA¬†2K¬†and you put the game sliders all the way up to 99 or 100. It‚Äôs just like, What the hell is going on? What is this dude doing? He‚Äôs making everything, making these crazy passes, dunking on people.
Padgett:¬†This will sound funny, but he had to learn how to play the game a little better. He‚Äôs always had a good IQ, but he needed to raise it even more and realize he couldn‚Äôt get away with what he did in high school purely from his athleticism. It took him a little while to realize that, but once he did, he figured it out and you could tell the difference.
Pitino (after a win over North Carolina in 2016):¬†He‚Äôs a freak athlete, and some of the rebounds you need, he goes and gets them, and you say, ‚ÄúOh, my God, did you see that?‚Äù Then he tries to dunk on plays that you don‚Äôt even think about dunking.
Bowden:¬†There‚Äôs no secret Coach P was religious when it came to how much video we watched. We had an app we used to put our games and edits on for the guys to watch. We could track how much and how often they were watching, and Donovan was always the No. 1 guy ‚Äî hours and hours ahead of everyone else. During the week, we‚Äôd watch two or three hours as a team. He‚Äôd go an extra 20 to 30 a week. He‚Äôd just be watching games or cut-ups of how the opposing guards were getting their shots off.

Mitchell averaged 7.4 points as a freshman during the 2015-16 season. (Jamie Rhodes/USA Today Sports)

Mitchell‚Äôs love for basketball and competition carried over to Minardi Hall, the on-campus dormitory for basketball players and undergraduate and graduate staffers.
Dwayne Sutton, redshirt freshman forward:¬†Donovan would always take his Xbox up to the film room in Minardi and plug it into the big projector. Sometimes it got real competitive. There‚Äôd be five or six of us and we‚Äôd play for hours.
Baumann:¬†They were just like 14-year-olds when they got the new¬†2K. You could hear them screaming while they were playing.
Lee:¬†I played the first three or four times with them in the beginning of the year, but then I realized those dudes took it way too seriously and I needed to stay on the second floor.
Adel:¬†We‚Äôd play every day in the summer to kill time between practices. Of course, I had the upper hand.
Sutton:¬†I‚Äôd say I was probably the best.
McMahon:¬†There was¬†a lot¬†of smack talk.
Melander:¬†That man loved¬†Rock Band¬†too. We bought¬†Rock Band¬†and it was in my room, and as soon as we got it, he asked us to buy a Cobra Starship song (2011 hit ‚ÄúYou Make Me Feel ‚Ä¶‚Äù). We always had our door open because guys would come in and play. Don played drums when he was little. He‚Äôd ask, ‚ÄúHey, can I play drums?‚Äù And we‚Äôd play that Cobra Starship song. He‚Äôd play that one song twice a week. He wanted to play that, put it on expert and play drums.
Baumann:¬†Everywhere they went they‚Äôd be talking about basketball or have some argument going on about it. In today‚Äôs terms it‚Äôd be like, Is Kawhi Leonard better than LeBron? Let‚Äôs debate it for the next six hours. If you walked into our team lounge, NBATV was on all day, every day. It‚Äôd be the Masters, and they‚Äôd have some archived NBA game from the second round of the 1999 playoffs on.
Lee:¬†It didn‚Äôt matter what time of the year it was, if we had two TVs in the facility, one of them was always on NBATV or ESPN, just watching old games.¬†How did this guy get that move off?¬†Some of the moves those older guys were doing in those games, Donovan incorporated into his game.
Mitchell eventually slimmed down. He cut his weight to 195 pounds in the summer before his sophomore season. Pitino told reporters at preseason media day, ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt recognize him.‚Äù¬†
Baumann:¬†Along with changing his game, he changed his body. He had elite-level speed with the ball. He was so quick. He kept guys in front of him. He was great in the press. Coach Pitino has that stigma about being obsessed with body fat and weight, but his vision for Donovan, Coach G‚Äôs execution of it and then Donovan‚Äôs own work ‚Äî it was a considerable aspect to him becoming a pro and being successful in our system.
That offseason, Mitchell and Adel sought out former Cardinals who had returned to town for the summer. They played in top-secret late-night pickup games, which featured Rajon Rondo and former Cards star Larry O‚ÄôBannon, among others.
O‚ÄôBannon:¬†We had closed sessions, and most of the time it was professionals, whether they played in the NBA or the EuroLeague or wherever. We didn‚Äôt want just anybody coming in. There were certain unspoken rules. If you‚Äôre going to play, play hard, but don‚Äôt cross the line and get anybody hurt. From the jump, you could tell he had no fear. He had an alpha mentality.
Adel:¬†We had individual workouts in the morning, then class, then study hall, then we‚Äôd get shots up. We‚Äôd usually nap and eat dinner, then come back at night and work out more. We‚Äôd get two or three workouts in every day. You could see his progress every time we played.
O‚ÄôBannon:¬†He was so eager to learn. He‚Äôd pull you aside and ask what he could do better. We‚Äôd talk to him and try to slow the game down for him. But he was confident too. He had a man‚Äôs body, a pro‚Äôs body. He caught one alley-oop that was low and on the wrong side and dunked it, and I said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got¬†it.‚Äù With college kids, when the game was on the line or closer to game point, they tended not to shoot the ball and they‚Äôd give it back to the pros. Not Donovan. He wasn‚Äôt afraid of the moment. He did it in a humble way, but that stuck out. He felt like he belonged.
Before his sophomore year, Mitchell started popping up in mock drafts, but he struggled with his shooting in the early weeks of the season. Padgett says the staff saw promising plays, but he played just OK in a 73-70 win over Kentucky and struggled in a loss against Virginia. So three days later, in a rivalry showdown with Indiana on New Year‚Äôs Eve, Pitino pulled Mitchell from the starting lineup.
Pitino (after the IU game):¬†I like to change things when you lose, get people out of their comfort zone. I said, ‚ÄúLook, son, I never thought I‚Äôd take you out of the starting lineup, but I need a star who wants to play like a star.‚Äù That means he‚Äôs not counting his misses. He‚Äôs someone who shoots every open shot, creates and doesn‚Äôt worry about what the outside world thinks of his game. I said, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre a star, but you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a star.‚Äù
Baumann:¬†One thing that makes (Pitino) great is how he coaches his star players. He was hard on them. He didn‚Äôt give them any leeway. The great ones are the ones who can take it and move on and use it. Donovan was like that. He‚Äôd take it and try to get better.
Adel:¬†When we rode up to Indianapolis on the bus, I was like, Man, don‚Äôt worry about not starting. Be aggressive. Be yourself. And he just had a look. I just thought, He is ready to go.
McMahon:¬†I was stressed about that game. They had Thomas Bryant and O.G. Anunoby. They had guards who could take the game over. But that was a turning point in our season. We started to look to Donovan as our go-to guy.
Mitchell scored what was then a career-high 25 points in 77-62 victory.
Adel:¬†As soon as he got in the game, he took it over. He was making pro shots. From there he took off.
Padgett:¬†It reminded me of when Terry Rozier was a sophomore and we went to Western Kentucky. Montrezl Harrell gets thrown out of the game because of a scuffle. We go into halftime up five or six, and Terry comes out of the gates and scores something like 17 straight and we win. That IU game was the same thing for Donovan. That was the springboard.
Mitchell became the first (and still only) Cardinal to make the All-ACC first team, averaging 15.6 points, 4.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.1 steals per game. Louisville earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament but lost to Michigan in the second round. In the minutes after the gam",08-01-2019,1564641958.0

utahjazz,hell,"LAS VEGAS ‚Äî His Team USA jersey still attached, his signature sneakers yet to be shed from his feet, Utah Jazz shooting guard Donovan Mitchell engaged in a spirited discussion with Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo.

The conversation was good natured, and yet competitive. It was pointed, yet comedic, focusing on their days as centerpieces of the classic Louisville/Kentucky rivalry. The two talked about who dunked on whom, whose team got the win (of course), and whose point guard crossed up the other‚Äôs big man. Mitchell was in a comfort zone, which makes sense because Louisville got the win in his sophomore season.

But, it was time to make Mitchell a little uncomfortable.

It was time to ask him why.

Mitchell playing for Team USA this summer doesn‚Äôt come without a bit of risk/reward. But, what is the risk for him, or Joe Ingles, or Rudy Gobert? And what is the reward, especially for Mitchell? How does his initial foray into playing for his country affect his obligation to the Utah Jazz? There are multiple answers to each question.

And in a sit-down with The Athletic, to his credit, Mitchell didn‚Äôt dodge those questions. So, here are some of the pros and some of the cons of Mitchell participating in the World Cup, from his words, and from an analysis point of view.

Pro ‚Äî Leadership experience: Because of so many players dropping off the roster to focus on their individual teams, Mitchell‚Äôs been thrust into a leadership position, which is significant. With the Jazz, Mitchell is very much the face of the franchise, but he hasn‚Äôt had to stretch his leadership legs much because there are so many highly respected veterans in the locker room.

With Team USA, there are definitely veterans on the roster, people like Kyle Lowry, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, and PJ Tucker, among others. But Mitchell projects to be an important cog on both ends of the floor. There very well could come a time where he is counted on to take an important shot, maybe even a last shot. There probably comes a time where he has to direct traffic, on and off the floor. For Mitchell, having responsibility in an international setting can only help him when it comes to the Jazz. Call it another step in his maturation process, which has been nothing but accelerated in his short time as a pro.

With the Jazz, Mitchell‚Äôs job has been to score, first last and foremost. With Team USA, he will be asked to make plays for himself, sure. But he‚Äôs going to have to make plays for others as well. Will the experience make him a more well-rounded player? That‚Äôs a good question. But, there‚Äôs a good chance the experience at the very least gives him the opportunity to be a more well-rounded player.

Mitchell: ‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs about finding some ways to do other things. I know that I‚Äôm coming to a team where there are a lot of guys who score a lot of points for their teams. So, this is an opportunity to be a little different.‚Äù

Con ‚Äî Potential injury: Mitchell immediately looked down to the floor on UNLV‚Äôs practice court and knocked on wood. He had just been asked about the downside of playing for Team USA, and the first answer to that is an obvious one: He can get hurt.

This isn‚Äôt without precedent, of course. Not many who follow the NBA closely can forget the night Paul George suffered a serious injury, which derailed him for almost two years, and essentially set the Indiana Pacers back for a few years. Mitchell, and every other player on the roster, knows that risk. He also knows that fate is fate. Some things aren‚Äôt in his control.

Here‚Äôs the thing to understand: If Mitchell weren‚Äôt playing for Team USA, that wouldn‚Äôt mean he wouldn‚Äôt be playing basketball. He‚Äôd be working out every morning, trying to refine his game heading into year three. He‚Äôd be lifting and participating in pickup runs. He‚Äôd be heading back to Salt Lake and participating in OTA‚Äôs in prep for training camp.

There‚Äôs risk in all of that, and Mitchell knows it. But, for him, Team USA is a once in a lifetime opportunity. He had to take it.

Mitchell: ‚ÄúI know that I can get hurt. I can get hurt getting out of bed. There‚Äôs a possibility of getting hurt any time. So, for me, I‚Äôm approaching this like I‚Äôm blessed to be here and that I‚Äôm blessed to be a part of this. They could have chosen anyone, and they decided to choose me, so I want to make the most of this opportunity. In this game, you just don‚Äôt get many of these opportunities.‚Äù

Pro ‚Äî Defensive improvement: Mitchell‚Äôs been able to hone in on some of the weakness of his game, namely his defense. That holds some irony, because Mitchell was a terrific defender at Louisville, and has been rather lackluster at times on that end with the Jazz.

A reason for that is his offensive responsibility being so great. Mitchell‚Äôs been Utah‚Äôs central playmaker for the last two seasons. But with Mike Conley, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Joe Ingles, Mitchell projects to have a lot more help. That, in theory at least, could give Mitchell more energy to be more competitive at the other end.

With Team USA, his defense has been a focus. He‚Äôs challenged himself on that end. He‚Äôs dug in and worked. It‚Äôs something that he wants to improve heading into this season with the Jazz.

Mitchell: ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre being honest, I couldn‚Äôt be happy with my defense last year, I definitely need some improvement there. I look at some of the great players in this league. Those guys are two-way players. I want to be that. I want to be good on both ends of the floor. I wasn‚Äôt happy with my defensive effort last year, so I really want to improve in that area.‚Äù

Con ‚Äî Fatigue: The short turnaround from the World Cup to training camp ‚Äî two weeks ‚Äî is a main reason for so many of the players on the original roster dropping out. And, that‚Äôs real. The Jazz are finally in position to chase a title this season. Three of their most important players are going to log heavy minutes for their respective national teams.

Ideally, the Jazz would love for their guys to be fresh heading into camp and the preseason. And Mitchell is aware that fatigue can play a factor. At the same time, it‚Äôs something that he‚Äôs thought about, and has some thought about.

Mitchell: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm young. I‚Äôm headed into my third year in the league, and I‚Äôm still 22 years old. Plus, a lot of the guys that decided they didn‚Äôt want to play, they‚Äôve done this before. I haven‚Äôt. This is something that I‚Äôm blessed to experience, and an experience that I would like to make the most of.‚Äù

Pro (maybe the most important pro for Mitchell) ‚Äî Confidence: It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs lacking in that department. But playing the game at the highest level, playing the game for your country, that‚Äôs a unique feeling. Like Mitchell said, he was chosen for this roster. Sources say he‚Äôs been a standout in the first couple of days of camp. He‚Äôs refined his body. He‚Äôs in the best shape of his short career. He looks like he‚Äôs aware of what is potentially in front of him and the Jazz.

The Jazz have a lot of weapons on both ends of the floor. At the same time, Mitchell is the player on the roster with the superstar ceiling. The closer he gets to reaching that ceiling, the better the chances are for the Jazz to compete for a title.

And maybe more important: Mitchell could either come into camp fatigued or he can come into camp in rhythm. It took him three months to catch a rhythm last season. If he hits the ground running this season, then him playing with Team USA becomes a significant pro.",08-07-2019,1565224318.0
